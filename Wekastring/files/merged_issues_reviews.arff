If you separate all the problems caused by particular hardware and Android implementations, you will see that this email client, though not perfect-because there is no such thing- has no equal.

All it needs is for you to learn how to use it. I have been using it for a very long time and have always found work arounds for the unexpected quirks generated by the ware and tear of its use.

Each time K-9 loses its cinfiguration it offers a button for restoring a saved cinfiguration and you get to pick the file you want to restore from.

' One of the nicest looking email programs if you like dark theme For 90% of my email, this works great using the dark theme.  But for one type, it just wont work (it used to, but either the app changed a while back, or the sender changed formats).  For example, I get email promotions from Frys Electronics that has images for the special deals.  With this app, using the dark theme,  they are all totally blank.  I can click on one, and be taken to the web page via the browser, but thats a pain, and I cant even tell what it is first.  Using the light theme works fine.  Ive tried both "show pictures" and "download complete message", but neither one works for these images.  Id enter a bug report, but they make it too hard to do unless you know exactly what the cause is.  I can provide an example, but I dont know why it happens because most email looks fine.  Its probably something to do with the email source.  I tried another email app with a dark theme, and it behaved the same way.',

Also it is very customizable.  2 of my favorite items, instead of having black text on a white screen, they have a dark mode which is a dark screen background with white text. Saves on battery life.  Also you can put different folders in to categories and view only those categories you choose. This app ROCKS!!!',

In my experiments, the execution of those functions on the main thread may be the main cause of the eye-detectable delays (i.e., hang-bug) experienced with K9 while opening emails.Moving work off the main thread leads to higher responsiveness of the app. I suspect that it is actually possible to run the ""clean"" and ""getAsString"" functions on a background thread.

I checked the following: - Using the Share functionality between other applications works: I tested between Amaze, OpenKeychain, TurboEditor and a few native SailfishOS applications.  - Using the Share functionality in other Android applications in order to send a file to K-9 Mail always crashes K-9 in exactly the same way (as described above), no matter if K-9 was running or not. - Sharing data (not a file) does not crash K-9 Mail, but seems to exhibit another bug: a handle (?) is inserted into the mail body, not the data sent, e.g. with data sent from BarcodeScanner:   [Subject] Barcode Scanner - Plain text  [Body] . ?id=com.fsck.k9  I will file a separate bug report, when sufficiently tested to write up something more comprehensive.- It also makes no difference, which Android application is picked, when using the Share functionality from within K-9 Mail for attaching a file to an email: K-9 always crashes.  Tested with Amaze file manager and TurboEditor.  - Only when I pick SailfishOS native Gallery application (which is the third application offered besides Amaze and TurboEditor when attaching a file in K-9 Mail on my Jolla Phone), K-9 does not crash and the file is indeed attached.  But it is not Androids internal Share mechanism being used here, instead the still somewhat fragile Share functionality between Android and SailfishOS applications provided by Jollas SailfishOS 2 is utilised.  In this specific case (attaching a file to an email in K-9) it even works consistently stable, but unfortunately SailfishOS native Gallery app allows to select picture file formats (e.g. jpg, png), only. - After downgrading from K-9 Mail 5.010 to 5.008, the Share functionality works fine, again. I am sure willing to make further tests, checks and balances, when provided with instructions how to. Please do try to fix that, as the inability to attach arbitrary files to emails in K-9 Mail renders the beautiful and feature laden K-9 useless as a generic email client. Cheers and Kudos for maintaining and enhancing the best mobile email client I am aware of.  And I am really looking forward to the progress on PGP/MIME. P.S.: I suspect the MIME handling changes introduced in K-9 Mail 5.009 to be the cause.  From K-9s changelog on .  5.010[...]5.009[...]Improved MIME type handling when other apps share files to K-9 Mail[...]"',

' "Incomplete sync with IMAP-InboxI have a somehow strange behaviour since a couple of weeks: The inbox of my imap-mail-account (at 1&1) is not correctly synced any more. With Thunderbird or the 1&1-Webmail, I can see all my mails, but K9 only shows a few. When I get new mails, K9 does not show most of them, only some.This seems to be limited to the inbox. Other IMAP-folders can be synced and seem to display all mails.I tried to clean up the inbox-folder (""expunge"" with K9 and according operations with thunderbird/webmail client), but no effect.I use the current version of K9 (v5.006) under Android 5.0 on two different Samsung devices. Is there any more information I should provide that could help?"', 
' Used K9 as my primary Android client for several years, and have been happy with it for the most part. Easy to configure, not a resource hog and hardly ever encounter a problem. Doesnt seem to work perfectly with Google mail (some issues with keeping my mailbox synced across devices / messages not downloading to other clients once K9 has retrieved it, despite several times checking settings) but this is minor. For me, K9s biggest strength was as a simple to use POP3 client, which has become a little diminished now that many ISPs are no longer providing / have withdrawn email services. Despite these minor criticisms, I still prefer K9 over anything else on Android. I have to agree that the new icon is terrible - it looks like the naughty Coyote that would signal my game of Dragon World on a BBC computer at school was over!', 
' I think its the best webmail client after gmail', 
' Wow! I Didnt Realize I Had So Much Crap In My Inbox I really love K9. I used TypeApp for quite a while and actually would recommend it above all the other email apps, except this one. Once I installed K9 and synced my mail it was so easy to see all the crap that needed to be cleaned out.  I also love the simple, some would say "outdated", interface. PLEASE DONT CHANGE IT!', 
' Top notcher Tried many apps for my webmail account on android. This is easily the best. Its cool and easy to use. Integrates with webmail server like a breeze. Well done.', 
' Clean and simple Straightforward, solid email client.', 
' Much better than Samsungs mail app This IMAP client is clean, intuitive, and feature-complete.', 
' Works pretty well on Pop/SMTP which my institutional webmail is using, worked better than androids default email app', 
' Missing support for IMAP keywords ("todo tags") A great alternative! Made the switch because the stock e-mail client couldnt sync anything except inbox due to folder structure. But Im hugely missing support for IMAP keywords! In order to tag from the phone and get the tags synchronised to Thunderbird and (Roundcube) webmail.', 
' Solid mail app Clean and easy to use for me.', 
' "Request post-auth capabilities if not provided them in the OK AUTH responseEmails are pushed to my phone, because the IMAP server supports it.Emails arent pushed to my phone.When I connect with openssl I see the following:```openssl s_client -crlf -connect imap.uni-stuttgart.de:993* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4REV1 LITERAL+] perdition ready on mail-proxy.tik.uni-stuttgart.de 00029957a login ******** *************************a OK You are so ina capability* CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LITERAL+ CHILDREN XAOL-OPTION NAMESPACE QUOTA IDLEa OK CAPABILITY Completed```The perdition proxy does not announce IDLE, but after login the capability is announced.

' Happy user for 6 years Always been an amazing email app. Would give 6 stars immediately (and if possible) if devs added Wear capability. Would love to be able to read emails on my Moto 360, not just subject lines.',

' Cant login to my yorku mail account',

' "High battery consumption (request: disable sync on low radio signal?)Hey there,I am a long time K9 user which is using K9 for almost 5 years now. Everything is working perfectly except one thing: Battery consumption is way too high when K9 is just running in the backround.I am running 2x gmail push accounts + 2x own-mail-server imap accounts on a Nexus 6 (previously Nexus 4 and HTC Desire HD).On my large Nexus 6 screen 2hours of ""screen on time"" is consuming as much or sometimes less battery than K9 which would run in the backround. On my Nexus4, K9 would sometimes completely drain the battery within 1 hour.My guess is that K9 is using so much battery because of low radio signals or being not connected to HSDPA?I tried creating a tasker script which would disable android auto-sync (which also stops auto-sync + push in K9) when the radio signal is low for a certain amount of time and only reactivate it when the signal is good again for a certain amount of time.Battery consumption is still high but better than before so I am wondering if K9 could get this feature out-of-the-box?I dont know what other ways are possible to minify battery consumption but K9 is, just right now as I am writing here, still using 1% more battery than my screen would use in those 30-40mins of writing (I am connected to WiFi at home or have full HSDPA+ signal while driving in thr car).For troubleshooting:I re-installed K9 several times (also on several devices). Sizes of e-mail accounts (if relevant):Gmail push #1: 114MBGmail push #2: 6MBOwn mail server imap #1: 331kb (syncs every 10 mins)Own mail server imap #2: 3MB (syncs every 10 mins)Thanks in advance !"',

' Changing this review, as the old one was about the interface change that nearly made me quit using the app a few years ago.  Since the last update, K-9 has been draining battery like crazy.  Im beginning to think it may have to do with the app getting stuck trying to refresh IMAP mail when there is a loss of network or network change, like changing from wireless to cellular data.   It apparently just churns away.  Side note:  I cant stand the new icon.  The older one was a bit odd and kitschy but it was comfortable and familiar.  The battery issue would get any other app a 1 or 2 star rating, but since K-9 is the only app I still use, that I used on my first android, it gets a slight pass (along with hope that it will be fixed.)', 
' I came looking for a secure email solution, and found a nice unexpected surprise... the ONLY email app I know of that lets you use a DARK theme.

' Love the features and flexibility, particularly for managing several different email accounts and being able to NOT have to use conversation view.  However, the app periodically stops working. How is that possible? Runs great for weeks, then suddenly it stops syncing. Or starts throwing authentication errors. Or, randomly hangs and consumes 30% of my battery.  I clearly dont understand app development because what should be done is the developers fix the bugs and then simply stop. Dont do anything else after that. Have a great new idea? Call it K-10 Mail and let those who need changes for the sake of changes over reliability download that.',

' Stopped working...no push. Been brilliant for ages but now have to go to app to get mail. Become a pain in the bum. Please fix it.', 
' Ive found the solution to the "syncing disabled" issue that some people have been experiencing on Android Nougat.   On Android Nougat there are 2 processes that restrict apps and put unused processes to sleep. First is "App Power Monitor" which is a Samsung feature that puts apps to sleep that havent been used or accessed for a while so they dont keep running in the background consuming unnecessary battery power and memory. This is the one that most people seem to know about and have tried but without much success. This is because there is a second, albeit very similar process that is actually causing the issue.  Its something called called "App Optimisation" which is a built in Google Android feature designed to put certain apps to sleep or (Dose) when the phone is locked for a certain length of time so it doesnt wake the phone up for example while youre asleep.  It is this thats actually stopping K9 Mail from syncing. I have a feeling that what is happening is, the sync process is being put to sleep after the phone has been locked for a certain amount of time but upon waking up the phone, the sync is not being switched back on again.  To solve this issue, go to Settings/Device Maintenance/Battery and click on the [Battery Usage] button next to the estimated battery life %. Now on the battery usage screen click on the top right menu and select "Optimize Battery Usage". Here you will see a list of apps that are not being monitored. As you will see, there is a warning message at the top of this page saying that "optimising apps that rely on sync data may be affected" which is a big clue why your email client might not be syncing. You will also interestingly see that the built in stock email app has by default already been made exempt (not optimised) so clearly it is not meant to be switched on for email applications. So lets go ahead and turn it off for K9 Mail.  First, click on where it says "Apps Not Optimised" and select "All Apps" from the drop down menu. Scroll down until you find K9 Mail from the list of available apps and go ahead and uncheck it. Now when you go back to the pull down menu and select the option to view Apps Not Optimised you will see that K9 Mail has been added to the list of exemptions and therefore background sync will not be put to sleep.  This should resolve the issue. Since I have done this my email has been working fine.', 
' Very good email client! FIX FOR "SYNCING DISABLED" :   Its caused by your phone battery management that kills the poll. Go to your settings, search for battery management, and look for k9 and define "ignore battery optimization for this app".

Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems, only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month.

' Good email app; battery drain As an e-mail app for Android, I love K-9. Its flexibility means you can do anything you want (I never hit limits), and the UI is intuitive and easy to work with.  However: I recently noticed my phone was draining its battery too fast. I did some tests, fully charging the phone, rebooting it, leaving K-9 open in the background to pick up my emails, but reading them with another app I wanted to try out. 10 hours later, K-9 had run up one hour of "keep awake" time (even though I hadnt opened the app once - it was all background) and the other app (that Id used throughout the day) just 9 minutes. So I disabled K-9, but the "keep awake" time kept increasing one minute in ten, so some background process was obviously thrashing the CPU.  The next day, phone rebooted, K-9 disabled - the phone is cooler to touch and its charge lasted the full day. I dont know which update introduced the problem, but at some point K-9 has started using too much battery, where other apps (used in the same way) have not.  I like the app enough to return to it - after some more upgrades, especially if they mention battery issues - Ill probably give it another try.',

The first 3x it happened with my 4 accounts I freaked, changing all 4 acct p/w. Until I realized it was THIS STUPID APP using archaic security methods. So after many many years, hoping K-9 would adopt the current approved login authentication but refuses to so...K-9 has to go!

' Was great...now its not!! Used to be able to click a check box & delete a bunch of email at once.  Now that feature is gone.  Why would you remove a helpful productivity tool?

My only, very minor gripes, are that sometimes its not clear what some of the icons mean (getting better with new releases).

' Was better, now not so much The "old" K-9 mail was great, and reliable.  The "new" one however has a lot of bugs, the most irritating being the one where you view a message and get a blank page.   I like the new interface..its more like GMail and yet it has adopted some of the more irritating features of the "new" GMail (like the icons).  I hope that they fix the "blank message" bug soon because it is really getting on my nerves.',

When I setup my exchange account, the app told me that my server REQUIRES me to allow it full access and control over MY phone. Bye bye. K-9 was setup in about a minute and a half, didnt need to allow access to any of MY personal information, and the interface looks to be well thought out and user friendly. I especially like the "split screen in landscape view". Granted, I havent looked around that much, but this app works perfectly for me, so Im done looking, on to better things. I dont even care that Gmail isnt supported. Great job, guys! Update 4/15/14: Gmail is supported but I ran into some problems when I decided to change settings on my Exchange account. Basically, every change I made caused some function to fail. Display, sync, notification problems got worse and worse until finally the app was beginning to make me feel stupid, so I uninstalled and moved on to a paid app. Regular IMAP/POP email is OK, but needs more work in order to use Exchange accounts.',

' Good E Mail client, not best for exchange This is a good e mail client for most of the EMail purpose. However, limited signature customisation and no contact sync with server makes it less useful exchange client for me. Would love to give five star when these two updates are available in future.',

This allows for optimisation of SMTP network traffic# Expected behaviourWe should change the behaviour of `sendMessageTo` to use pipelining to reduce round-trip-delay when we receive the PIPELINING extension.# Actual behaviourRegardless of PIPELINING extension status we always wait for each response# Developer notesThe hard part here will be implementing SMTP command handle for asynchronous responses. Likely a queue of outstanding responses will need to be maintained.Theres ample opportunity for testing here - the SmtpTransportTest code allows you to provide dummy responses from an SMTP Server. There should be tests written for:* Using pipelining when it is enabled* Ensuring pipelining is not tried when it is not enabled* Ensuring that we wait for all responses to pipelined operations before considering the message sent* Ensuring that we handle failures to one or more pipelined operations properly (and still read the remaining pipeline responses)The RFC contains examples for much of these: . 1. Enable verbose logging2. Send an email to Gmail or another server that supports PIPELINING3. Analyse the traffic"',

The only improvement I could think of that this app could use would be support for S/MIME encryption.   Ive been able to use Djigzo to send and view encrypted emails, but its a clumsy solution.  Having it integrated into K-9 would be perfect.',

' "Email Notifications on Android WatchI love K-9 mail and love my new LG Urbane. I correctly get notifications for new email on the watch but when I select to delete it, the confirm delete notification pops up on the phone. So it is not possible to complete the entire delete email operation from the watch.This works correctly with the Gmail application but it doesnt have a confirm delete prompt. I suppose one option would be to disable the confirm delete dialog entirely or to disable it for just the phone.Working out the most desirable behavior for using a watch to dispatch the email is the first step. I have only had this watch a few weeks and am still getting used to it. K-9 I have used for a couple of years and am very happy with. AndroidWear is just a brave new world to figure out the Right Thing To Do (tm). :)"',

' "Allow another identity to be marked as the Sender of emails from an identityI have searched for existing issues, some relate to identities (e.g. #1117 or #935), but they are not addressing my problem/need.I would like to be able to use K9 the way I use Outlook user agent on my PC (and then be able to finally get rid off it!): in the from field, write any email address I want and have the mail sent with this address as ""From:"".When I use a K9 identity, the smtp server of my mail host (one.com) rejects the mail (error 554 5.7.1), but again, it works when I use Outlook. Why?I had a look in the headers of a successfully sent message (from Outlook UA): the From is what I typed, but the Sender is my regular email account with which I authenticate on the SMTP server. I am pretty fine with this. I would suspect K9 maybe puts my From address in the Sender header as well, which would cause the error, or maybe does not set it at all (I tried to see the headers of a rejected email (from K9), I havent seen the Sender tag, but it had not been sent, so...), which would be treated the same way.I have also spotted something strange: in the rejected emails headers, the message-ID was built with the domain of the From address, not the one of my actual SMTP account (Sender), maybe is it also a possible cause.Why all this? I own my domains, and I have set up specific sub-domains for emails. I can put anything before the @, and I will get emails sent to it (kind of catch-all, but with rules behind). That way, I dont have to actually create aliases (cumbersome), I can provide an arbitrary one any time, and it will work (most of the time, name/company/website@...). I can therefore spot when one of these addresses is misused and create a rule to trash all mails received through it if needed.However, this solution does not allow me to send mails, except with the Outlook UA. I havent found an Android UA capable of this (and I have tested a lot of them). I would just love if K9 was able to do it, either by default, or as an extra option in the identity settings.Please confirm how K9 handles the identities: as long as there is no SMTP settings per identity (I am personally not interested in this feature), it would seem logical to me that the Sender header (and message-ID) derive from the SMTP account being used to authenticate, not from the From header coming from the identity From email address, wouldnt it?K-9 Mail version: 5.203Android version: 6.0.1Account type  IMAP"',

Maybe, but for some reason the setup procedure picks up EVERY folder AND file on your host - in my case creating 4 times as many "email" accounts that actually existed. I suspect maybe a bug ?  So, for example, if you have a FILE on your server called myFile.php K9 picks this up as another email folder ! Seriously bad bit of design there. You have to manually select each error and mark it as "2nd class" to hide it (no multi-select option) - there is no apparent way to tell K9 to actually remove it.  Another issue - minor, but irritating - is if you click on an email with the intention of opening it, instead of opening it you instead get a list of emails from the same person. OK, so you can then click on the email AGAIN in this new list to actually ropen it but what an un-necessary step. Not a disaster, just annoying.

' K-9 needs improvements (function and debugging) to be competitive.  K-9 is a clean mail client with no ads and no unnecessary perms.  HOWEVER, K9 is buggy and has major functional deficiencies.  It is poorly integrated with contacts and it cannot acquire/learn new addresses that are directly entered into the "to" field of a new email or email reply.  It neither stores them in a local internal address book nor offers to add them to contacts. This is a very undesirable behaviour / deficiency.

' Incomming mail not showing in the unified inbox. We have to go to accounts and back to unified inbox to see the new incoming mail.', 
' For years, this was the best Android mail app available. Its unbelievable how the current developers have ruined such a fantastic email utility. Many of the old behaviors have been modified to work in unintuitive ways, demonstrating a lack of basic user ergonomics. The Unified Inbox in particular is a catastrophe. Now, unread messages show before read messages regardless of date or time. Read messages do not show at all (they completely disappear from Unified Inbox) UNLESS YOU READ THEM WITH ANOTHER CLIENT (such as your desktop PC). If you read a message with another client, it will appear below the list of unread messages, completely out of time/date order. The Unified Inbox worked perfectly in older versions, but whoever has been modifying the code for this section of K-9 is essentially incompetent.   There should be settings to configure the Unified Inbox behavior back to the old method if a user prefers that. It is after all the reason most of us switched to K9 in the first place. But the current behavior of showing messages read on another client in one way, and messages read in K-9 in another way, is just extremely poor development, and it needs to be fixed.',

' Clean and quick. But bug-ridden. To test K-9 I added only my Exchange (WebDav) account. Connection was flawless, and data was read fast. I went to the Unified Inbox and there was my Exchange email. I started to explore, and went into the inbox for the Exchange account. At this point, the messages were downloaded again. Returning to the Unified Inbox, all of the messages were duplicated--two of each. I checked the folder list under the Exchange account and there are two inboxes listed. Why? I uninstalled and reinstalled... messages get duplicated in the same folder. Its ridiculous. Then I added another account, used the "move up" option to rearrange the accounts in the list, and it *duplicated* the account!', 
' Recent update is fantastic! K-9 updated itself a couple months or so ago, and it was clearly quite the overhaul because they made a pretty good e-mail app fantastic. With the new changes I get a nice UI, a dark theme, and crazy good performance. Prior to the update I had to wait for five seconds every time I hit back from reading an email message, because it would take that long to reload the headers. Now all that wait is gone. I also have multiple (like, four) email accounts and they merge in a fast Unified Inbox with color coding.',

Thanks for a very good and useful app.  The devs had added a gmail like letter avatars, which is nice, but the above feature is still desired.', 
' Best email app on Android. First off its opensource which is always a plus in my book.  Second, unlike the native Android app which often loses its place when trying to load older messages.  Third, it has a simple message by message view that doesnt spontaneously refuse to display messages from people in threaded view based on conversations you are having with someone as has happened to me several times on the gmail app.  Finally, the unified mailbox lets me get all updates from all my email accounts as if it were a single account.',

' Last update made it so slow... Having difficulties working with it since its so damn slowish.', 
' Ive been having a problem in the last few months with the app constantly crashing when composing emails (and also after sending an email).  Have to start over and hope I can finish before it crashes again.', 
' Used to be good but now keeps crashing after upgrade. Sad because I really did like it.', 
' Long time user now sick and tired of the app constantly hanging and crashing', 
' Has gotten WORSE since the last update! Takes FOREVER to both open the app and when going from one email to another. Its VERY annoying! And still no print function! I found that very strange and would change my stars in a heartbeat if we can get a printing feature in this app!', 
' Worked fine up until last update. Now keeps crashing every time I try to compose an email (usually in the middle of it) without saving the draft. Really annoying.', 
' I generally prefer open source software, but crashing regularly on a Nexus 5x is forcing me to move on after many years.', 
' Used this app for years. It was good then became very slow and useless. After the current update, it works again. Fast now!',

Still by far the best email client.  /// (2013) I have used K9 for several years for my non-gmail account.  The current official version is 4.409, and it is excellent.  However, today I installed the latest version posted at the K9 Mail developers site, 4.512, and additional improvements make this email client stand out by some distance.  Even in comparison with Gmail.  Wow!',

' July 2017 update: Still crashing frrquently. I have sent dozens of crash reports. Most often crashes when reading email and rotating my phone from portrait to landscape. With certain emails, problem is repeatable every time.      Wish you could move an email between email accounts. Long-time user but frequent crashing has caused me to switch email apps. :(',

' Why has this app suddenly stopped working? I have used this app for at least 2 years with NO problems. Now all of a sudden it wont fetch my pop server email! What is going on?', 
' Most regretful update!  I have used this app for many years.  So far so good until the recent two updates that failed the authentication check.  Worse-still, after retrying, it ended up having one of my email accounts blocked as if its hijacked.  This happened on all my devices so I believe its not device- or os- specific, and I believe mine is not an isolated case.  I am going to uninstall this irresponsible app for good.', 
' The latest update on december 30th 2016 is giving a problem Attachments used to show on top of emails in earlier versions have now gone down at bottom of the thread. I am a k-9 user on android for about 5 years. Had issue with it for the first time. Kindly fix or give some option to roll back to earlier version. Thanks.',

' Light weight, functional and stable The Android default email app is v boring n dull. I use K-9 for my two Outlook, one Yahoo and one own domain accounts. My two Gmail accounts are handled by default Gmail app. Though I thought it was slow in push notifications, but that seems to be working ok now. Everything I want from an email app works flawlessly in K-9. Its lightweight and superior in overall performance. Thumbs up!',

' Use this app Though I have used K-9 Mail for over a year, Id not posted a review.  Im still using it so what ielse need be said?  Well, there is more.  I was prompted to post today because they just put out an update for an issue caused by an Android component update.  While it took weeks for this response, it now works again for me and in a world where sometimes these updates seem to never come, weeks is pretty good.',

However about 2 or 3 updates ago, it started crashing when opening certain messages or only displaying a tiny piece of the message, with the rest of the screen just a blank white space.  More recent updates have changed and tweaked this problem, but they havent managed to kill it yet, making the app very hard to use for productivity purposes.  Back to webmail for me, and will give 5 stars once the app is stable again!!',

' Great Till Update I have used k-9 for years until the latest update. Now I get crashes when it trys to retrieve mail. Im exploring alternatives.', 
' Last update killed it Was great before latest update. Now constantly crashes checking IMAP box with over 125 msgs.  Will start looking for a new app.', 
' Only works 50% of the time, the rest is certificate errors! Been using this app for years now, but its been a mess ever since the lollipop update, and it doesnt look to be improving! Might have to switch to another app :(', 
' Coming back to an old friend ... went over to Gmail for a while, like the newer UI. But it throws huge amounts of data on my limited dinosaur and even with that, is slow. Finally, too many problems with Play services so back to K-9. K-9s two stage downloading is most effective, quick, efficient.  UI could use a good update, but as-is, very usable and friendly.', 
' Nice app & easy use', 
' Love it I use this on all my phones and tablets. It has been crashing quite a lot lately but its usually only once a week and works fine after that.', 
' Stable mail app update solved the attachment issues. one main advantage is that on kitkat it is persistent in the background which gives my mail updates even though its killed via a app manger.', 
' Keeps crashing Its nice enough to use, but it crashes ALL THE TIME. Mainly after deleting messages, but at other times too.', 
' Back to great again! Update: Problem resolved by latest update and everything works perfectly again now. Thank you!', 
' Latest update Was great before latest update. I get error with certificate.', 
' Version 5.0 broke the app Do not use automatic update for this app. The latest version 5.0 is incompatible with most email providers and K9s response is to get you provider to upgrade their system. NOT customer friendly!',

' Latest upgrade broke it Keeps crashing, cannot use. Please fix!', 
' Cool app. Update: Devs: the Jan2014 update: the app crashes, is very unstable. Will update rating after the bugs are fixed. SG2 CM @ 4.3.1.  God bless you guys. Thanks for this great app. Working fine on the galaxy tab 1, A500, Note3 & GS2.',

' Broken since update!! Cant use it anymore, it keeps crashing!!!', 
' Has quit working with last update I use this app along with fire alert 2 in order to use my phone like a fire pager. The last update has ruined this app. It has worked great for months but not anymore............. After pulling my hair out, I think I have discovered the latest update requires the user to go into the settings and reconfigure different options and it seems to be working again. I guess now I can just say that a more detailed explanation on this would of helped.', 
' Top mail app Nice and stable since last updates! Great simple easy mail app. Thanks', 
' Great start A great start, just needs S/MIME support and it will be perfect.', 
' Has potential, however unstable Frequently stops receiving mail. Pain in the butt. I use it but wish it were more reliable.', 
' Crashes Worked wonderfully for a long time, then I did an update and it started crashing. Uninstalled it thinking it might need a wipe (cache/dalvik/folder delete) but now it wont even run after install. Crashes on start. Shameful.',

' Now, slower than ever. 3/6/2014. well, if I was originally unhappy with the new ui at (4.4), I bit the bullet and went with it anyway.  Not sure of my version, but my k9 auto updates, and for about 2 months, now dog slow (apology to dog lovers) with no setting changes on my part.   Now looking for alternatives. Great, to good, to below avg, to poor over 5 years.', 
' Was good while it worked After about a month of perfect operation k9 started crashing every time it tried to sync with the mail server. It appears to be a known issue but I couldnt see a resolution available. This stops it scoring 5 stars',

' Great until last update I have been using K9 for  about 2 years and really liked it. After the last update,  I am going to uninstall. The colors are obnoxious and I can no longer mark emails for deletion from the list.', 
' New version extremely slow. What have they done to K-9?  It is very slow and they have changed the menus completely for no apparent reason.  I may be looking for a new e-mail app.  Update: I reinstalled K9 and it is working better.  But why make us learn a new menu?', 
' Nice app Works well for me. Very tweakable', 
' K9 on galaxy nexus 4.2.2 slow after update - fixed. Im running 4.2.2 on a verizon galaxy nexus phone and after the last K9 update K9 was dog slow reading emails... like 20s reaction time.  The advice about RECREATE DATA worked for me like a charm.  K9 is great once again!  From the list of your email messages press the back/up (180 degree turn symbol) and the next menu up should have your account name. Thats the one to press to get the menu with RECREATE DATA.  As is warned, the local copy of your mail will be gone and hopefully redownloaded.  Worked for me at least.  And K9 response is now quicker then before the update.', 
' Update sucks - Appearance and Categories I have used this app for years and updated it last night.  The Gmail categories (which were not selected on my gmail) were added to K9, which sucks!  So, lucky for me, I use Titanium Backup and just restored the previous apk and data.  Im sure K9 will put out another update soon with the fixes for the things we dont like.    Other than that, love the app.  :o)  For now, 3 stars.', 
' Update introduces problems Running fine before latest update, now crashing frequently. App hangs up regularly and crashed my OS (first time ANY app has done that to my s3) Not happy!', 
' Ok, but . . . When it works its OK but its very unstable.   Especially when refreshing with new email it often just hangs or outright crashes with "IOException:readStringUntil()...".  Restarting the app usually fixes it but this seems to occur at least 1/day.  Samsung S3.', 
' Slow The previous version loaded the list of emails slow. The latest version does everything slow. Loading email,  selecting email,  deleting email,  etc.  Everything. Takes at least 2-3 seconds for the application to react to touching the screen. Recreating the account doesnt help. How do I roll back to the previous version?', 
' UNINSTALLING see UPDATE... Awesome 5 stars PLUS! I seldom give superb ratings, but this developer has now created an AWESONE, must-have app.  UPDATE : After update 4.409, SERIOUS LAG, FORCE CLOSES. NO HELP FROM DEV. UNINSTALLING CANT USE. UPDATE #2, TRIED INSTALLING AGAIN AND IM UN-INSTALLING AGAIN. TOTALLY USELESS, LOCKS CONSTANTLY, CANNOT EVEN ACCESS MAIL NOW. I OFFERED DEBUGGER HELP TO DEV, BUT WAS TOLD THEY DONT HAVE TIME. TOO BAD.', 
' Full featured and reliable. K9 does everything I want. The advanced configuration options make it very flexible but are tricky if you are not mail savvy. My only niggle is that it is sometimes really slow to update the screen.',

' K-9 Mail used to be really good, but it has gone downhill of late... Among other things, it suddenly stopped working with my (IMAP) e-mail servers (despite the fact that they work everywhere else!) and the only response from the developers (via github) is "we are working on improving the error messages". Unfortunately, I cant wait around for the developers to fix whatever it is they broke - particularly seeing as the comments on github suggest this might not be addressed for a while... If you want something Open Source and K-9 Mail works for you, stick with it as its the best Open Source offering out there; if you dont care about Open Source or K-9 Mail is not working for you too, well theres plenty of proprietary alternatives out there.', 
' Open source and supports encryption.  UI is not as fancy as some other email apps, but I can definitely live with it considering the security benefits you get with this one.', 
' First rate much better than the packaged android email client. Does exactly what it says it does. Highly recommended  Started using k9 way way back and its still by far the best email client for android....and now using it on my Chromebook which is now using android apps 😀', 
' Does everything I expect from a fully-featured email client. Even more importantly, its free and open-source software!', 
' This is a very easy to use app. I have had no problems using it and havent noticed any glitches or bugs.  Its a great alternative to Googles email client that comes with Android, for those of you who are concerned about  privacy online. I love the fact that its open source but I dont know if the code has been thoroughly audited. Having said that I still highly recommend over a proprietary email client.', 
' Very good mail client.', 
' K9 is simply the most customizable and powerful email app for Android plus it is open source!', 
' Good app and big + for it being open source, but the lack of multi message select puts me personally off :(', 
' This email client offers some nice advanced configuration options and it is open source, but like so many open source projects the user interface undermines all the back end magic. The UI is so terrible here that I find the entire app unusable. Uninstalling and now in search of something that was made for use by people other than the developers.', 
' Definitely a must for people who maintains more than two email addresses. One good thing is that when set up properly, it downloads the contents of your email locally - including the attachments.', 
' As of 10/2/2014 this app is unusable.  All I get are cert errors.  No way to get it to stop.  My hosting providers cert does not match my domain name, but most email apps allow you to ignore this.  Not sure if this is related to the error Im getting but it went from working to DoA after installing the new version.  Had to uninstall it and look for an alternative.', 
' On the road to perfection First off, its open source and you can build your own app from source files hosted on GitHub. Secondly, its a proper email client with non of the useless bells and whistles you see on other email clients (looking at you Gmail). Lastly, as of version 5.2, it now supports PGP/MIME (need the OpenKeyChain).  Gets better with each update.', 
' Quite nice indeed. Highly functional. Good performance. Good features. Open source. Ad-free. 5-8 POP3 and IMAP accounts managed simultaneously in K9 for a few years.', 
' Versatile, robust Mailer Reliable, easy with extensive functionality. Currently the back bone of my email traffic. To me the standard open source Mailer on Android.', 
' Free, open but painful to look at Feature rich and works really well. I love that its open source. The user interface is very dated, though. Text and buttons are crammed on my display. Colors are less than appealing. Terrible UX makes this difficult to use.',

' "Message Send Failed ""Signing requested, but no key selected!""On the current git HEAD, on a device without any PGP apps installed, composing and then sending a message fails with a toast saying ""Signing requested, but no key selected!"".  The effect of this is that e-mails cant ever be sent.Looking at the code this seems to be due to [line 51 of RecipientPresenter.java](.  which checks `isMissingSignKey()` which is true when `signingKeyId` is `null` in the current `cryptoStatus`.  If no PGP app is installed that value will always be `null`.I think the proper solution would be to have `isMissingSignKey()` also check if `cryptoStatus.cryptoMode` is `CryptoMode.DISABLE` and also set the `currentCryptoMode`, which currently defaults to `CryptoMode.OPPORTUNISTIC`, to default to `CryptoMode.DISABLE` as users without OpenPGP cant even open the menu to change modes.The following commit shows what I propose: .

' "key-aware recipient chooserFor sending of encrypted mail, the recipient picker should be crypto-aware. There are a couple of things to consider, and some design choices to make. Lets-a go:So first off, the material way to go is [chips](.  There are a couple of libraries for that, in OpenKeychain we use [TokenAutoComplete](.  which is mature and flexible but not quite material-design. There are also libraries based on Googles internal chips library from the GMail app, like [android-chips](.  but those arent really made to be anything else but regular contact pickers and I havnt found one which looked mature. Since material design in k-9 isnt really there yet anyways, I would go with the more established and maintained option here, i.e. TokenAutoComplete.So, what do we actually want to show in the list? At the moment, a list of e-mail addresses (not contacts) is shown, queried from `ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Email`. This is the obvious thing to show, and it seems more reasonable than a list of contacts so I would just keep it that way. What I would like to add is an annotation to each address about its crypto-status.In OpenKeychain, we have icons to show the key status - a green checkmark, yellow question mark, and some red ones for revoked/expired/unsuitable for operation. The problem is, outside of an explicit crypto context, its not clear that these icons are about the status of some encryption key, so we really cant use them here. We also dont need info about special states of a key - revoked or expired keys are simply irrelevant for recipient selection.My proposal would be to use Threemas concept: Three dots, with three states ""one in red"" / ""two in yellow"" / ""three in green"", all others greyed out. Check out ma [mock-up](.  The idea is to be mildly alarming (""just one of three""), but also suggest a way to progress (""key available, two out of three"", ""verified that thing, three out of three!"").A different approach would be a lock in different states (red/yellow/green with open / closed+questionmark / closed+checkmark), but Im a) missing the progress aspect of the three-dots concept, and b) an open red lock next to each mail address is just a tad too alarming - if the UI tells the user ""this is unsafe!"", they might just migrate to a different program which is equally unsafe but does nothing to inform the user about that fact.Some more thoughts:- if a valid (or even confirmed) key is available, the user will likely want to encrypt - optimize for that.- encryption without signing is not a reasonable use case and I would not support it.- pgp/mime vs pgp/inline is an orthogonal problem to everything mentioned here, I would leave it for later- do we need a contact-picker-button? the gmail app removed theirs recently.

In such a case, the fwknop server would create firewall rules to open the port requested for a few seconds.In these few seconds, the client can connect to the server because the ports are open.fwknop2 is an application available in Android as open source code.I suppose this fwknop2 application could be modified to have the possibility of being invoked to send the fwknop messages from the command line, and then, using the new feature just requested for k-9, open the ports before attemting to connect to the email server.```---------```1.2.3.K-9 Mail version:           For new versionsAndroid version:            For all versionsAccount type            For all account typesP.D.I suppose you are very busy with other implementations.In this case, I could offer my services to try to program this request.Although I am not very familiar with Android, I have quite experience programming with Java and I think I could succeed with this development.Please, let me know what do you think about it.Kind regards,Fran.

It works well except you cant deal with attachments because K9 doesnt know how to deal with the Chrome OS file system.  (Chrome OS is lacking a complete email client for combining email accounts.)

' 5.0RC1 almost certainly not ready for prime time. I love this app and its great for what I use it for -- multiple secure IMAP connections, including one to a fussy MSExchange service. But the latest version here stores HUGE numbers of "Exception: message count -1 for folder XXX" and I/O errors and PUSH errors in the K9 Errors folders -- and these arent errors. Theyre what happen when you walk around with a mobile device and change wifi speeds, access points, and cell towers. And those exceptions now take up space in your message storage for the app. Also theyve discontinued the option for older security methods -- and thats great for security, except when you have to turn security OFF because you cant personally upgrade the server you have to use. I may have to downgrade to maintain usability for my needs, but in all Im very happy with this app and the hard work from the development team to keep this a five-star product.',

' Good but also awkward Worked perfectly for my school email until it was changed to a Google host. Now funky in syncing and message layout. Worst part is not being able to star messages without tripping the scroll bar. I have to go into each individual message to star them.', 
' Been a K9 user for 3 yrs. Nice revised interface. Except the star location overlaps the navigation bar on the right Also, it changes to gmail style contact icon isnt that good nor practical.

I spent weeks trying to track down the problem. I did a reset on my phone and re-installed my critical Apps and the problem was still present. It would happen even when the phone was sitting on charge overnight. I called AT&T, and they admitted that this was one of the problems they were seeing since the Android 5 update but all they could offer was a $100 phone replacement with no guarantee that this was solve the problem. Then I realized that it often happened when I was checking my email with K9. I removed K9, rebooted my phone, and it has only crashed once in the last 7 days.

' "Wrong folder names for special-use folders with IMAP namespace prefixK9 seems to choose wrong names for special-use folders when the IMAP namespace has a prefix.Im using a Dovecot Server with the following configuration:```namespace {  type=private  prefix = INBOX/  separator = /   inbox = yes   mailbox Trash {    auto = subscribe    special_use = \Trash  }  mailbox Drafts {    auto = subscribe    special_use = \Drafts  }  [...]}```With this settings, K9 correctly recognizes every folder: The folder names in the list of all folders are shortened by the namespace prefix and I get folders like ""Inbox"", ""Junk"" and e.g. ""Archives/2015"". The real IMAP folder names are ""INBOX"", ""INBOX/Junk"" and ""INBOX/Archives/2015"".K9 also reads the configured special-use flag but here, the namespace prefix isnt stipped. Instead of using e.g. the ""Junk"" folder, K9 uses folders that are listed as e.g. ""INBOX/Junk"" in K9 (due to prefix stripping) and are effectively named ""INBOX/INBOX/Junk"".After setting up a new account in K9 with the server-settings mentioned above, the ""wrong"" folder names are also visible in the settings: Under `Account settings -> Folders` the special folders are listed as e.g. ""INBOX/Junk"" which redirects to the wrong folder as mentioned above. If you manually select the Junk folder, K9 will only display ""Junk"" in the settings.**Note** that Im not too deep into Dovecot configuration and therefore this could also be a wrong configuration in Dovecot.

It is also pretty lightweight and fast. After reading some of the reviews of problems after v.5.0x, I had to go and see what I had and I do have 5.001 which works just fine for me.

' A few quirks I wish would be fixed. Overall, its a very good email client. The best Ive seen on android. But really any setting beyond the most basic must be changed for each account individually. I ask for an option where you can select what settings to apply to all selected accounts. Currently, I find a setting I want to change, then end up changing it 8 more times for my other accounts. If this could be changed, it would be 5 stars. As it is, changing the settings for all the accounts individually is too much of a pain.',
