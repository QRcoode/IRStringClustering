"Hang problem in HtmlSanitizer.java. Dear K9 Developers,I am implementing a hang-bug detection tool and I am analyzing K9 (master version downloaded yesterday) with it.

In my experiments, the execution of those functions on the main thread may be the main cause of the eye-detectable delays (i.e., hang-bug) experienced with K9 while opening emails.Moving work off the main thread leads to higher responsiveness of the app. I suspect that it is actually possible to run the ""clean"" and ""getAsString"" functions on a background thread.

"WhatsApp sharing problem (8-bit encoding). Using K9 from PlayStore, v5.006, Samsung Galaxy S5.Open a WhatsApp chat where you received an image. Push for a long time on image to select it, choose to share with K9.K9 will compose and send the message, but the image attachment is unreadable for the recipient.The problem does not appear when you single tap on a WhatsApp image to zoom it, and then share from here.Analyzing the received email: K9 is encoding the attachment with Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit, but I think the 8bit body is not correct, because it contains  in the wrong position, not permitted by MIME RFC 2045 .

"My k9 does not verify Sign after download.

"Email Notifications on Android Watch. I love K-9 mail and love my new LG Urbane. I correctly get notifications for new email on the watch but when I select to delete it, the confirm delete notification pops up on the phone. So it is not possible to complete the entire delete email operation from the watch.This works correctly with the Gmail application but it doesn't have a confirm delete prompt. I suppose one option would be to disable the confirm delete dialog entirely or to disable it for just the phone.Working out the most desirable behavior for using a watch to dispatch the email is the first step. I have only had this watch a few weeks and am still getting used to it. K-9 I have used for a couple of years and am very happy with. AndroidWear is just a brave new world to figure out the Right Thing To Do (tm). :)",enhancement+

"Add support for GCM cipher suites. The current list of cipher suites leaves out the GCM cipher suites, which are more secure than the CBC cipher suites, as they avoid the inherent issues with verifying padding.
