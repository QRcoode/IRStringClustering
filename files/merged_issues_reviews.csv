"The best POP/SMTP mail client, of those I've tried, available from Play Store.  Four issues short of a 5-start rating: 1.  The too-frequent 'crash and die' failures. 2.

No spelling checker (please start with en-gb ;-).  4. The 'Unread messages' indicator shown on the widget selector, doesn't exist.

"""[Bug: Regression] Upgrading from K-9 Mail 5.008 to 5.010 breaks its Share functionality under AlienDalvik (AOSP 4.1.2): K-9 always crashesUpgrading from K-9 Mail 5.008 to 5.010 breaks its Share functionality when attaching a file to an email under AlienDalvik (based on AOSP 4.1.2) in Jolla's SailfishOS 2.0.1.11 K-9 always crashes, a pop up window is displayed stating, """"Unfortunately the application com.fsck.k9 has stopped. [OK]"""". By clicking on [OK], K-9 restarts, and saves the message in the Drafts folder, but without the file being attached. I checked the following: - Using the Share functionality between other applications works: I tested between Amaze, OpenKeychain, TurboEditor and a few native SailfishOS applications.  - Using the Share functionality in other Android applications in order to send a file to K-9 Mail always crashes K-9 in exactly the same way (as described above), no matter if K-9 was running or not. - Sharing data (not a file) does not crash K-9 Mail, but seems to exhibit another bug: a handle (?) is inserted into the mail body, not the data sent, e.g. with data sent from BarcodeScanner:   [Subject] Barcode Scanner - Plain text  [Body] . ?id=com.fsck.k9  I will file a separate bug report, when sufficiently tested to write up something more comprehensive.- It also makes no difference, which Android application is picked, when using the Share functionality from within K-9 Mail for attaching a file to an email: K-9 always crashes.  Tested with Amaze file manager and TurboEditor.  - Only when I pick SailfishOS' native Gallery application (which is the third application offered besides Amaze and TurboEditor when attaching a file in K-9 Mail on my Jolla Phone), K-9 does not crash and the file is indeed attached.  But it is not Android's internal Share mechanism being used here, instead the still somewhat fragile Share functionality between Android and SailfishOS applications provided by Jolla's SailfishOS 2 is utilised.  In this specific case (attaching a file to an email in K-9) it even works consistently stable, but unfortunately SailfishOS' native Gallery app allows to select picture file formats (e.g. jpg, png), only. - After downgrading from K-9 Mail 5.010 to 5.008, the Share functionality works fine, again. I am sure willing to make further tests, checks and balances, when provided with instructions how to. Please do try to fix that, as the inability to attach arbitrary files to emails in K-9 Mail renders the beautiful and feature laden K-9 useless as a generic email client. Cheers and Kudos for maintaining and enhancing the best mobile email client I am aware of.  And I am really looking forward to the progress on PGP/MIME. P.S.: I suspect the MIME handling changes introduced in K-9 Mail 5.009 to be the cause.  From K-9's changelog on .  5.010[...]5.009[...]Improved MIME type handling when other apps share files to K-9 Mail[...]""",66,bug+

Excellent App-Would like to see two changes I have been using the app for a while and it is the best I have used. Two things I wish that it had: 1) swipe to delete like gmail and solmail and 2) access to a reply button when you are reading an email in landscape mode.,77,_
Thread listed multiple times in the message listSometimes threads are listed more than once in the message list.This is because of a bug in the query to create the threaded message list in `EmailProvider`.

"""Report a possible race issueHi, Developers of k9mail/k-9,I am writing to report a race issue on use of ConcurrentHashMap. The issue is reported by our tool in an automatic way. Although manually confirmed, it would be a false positive, given we do not know the specification of the program. We would very appreciate if you could check below for details and confirm with us whether it is a real problem. For more information, please refer to our website: .

"""Incomplete sync with IMAP-InboxI have a somehow strange behaviour since a couple of weeks: The inbox of my imap-mail-account (at 1&1) is not correctly synced any more. With Thunderbird or the 1&1-Webmail, I can see all my mails, but K9 only shows a few. When I get new mails, K9 does not show most of them, only some.This seems to be limited to the inbox. Other IMAP-folders can be synced and seem to display all mails.I tried to clean up the inbox-folder (""""expunge"""" with K9 and according operations with thunderbird/webmail client), but no effect.I use the current version of K9 (v5.006) under Android 5.0 on two different Samsung devices. Is there any more information I should provide that could help?""",82,bug+
"Used K9 as my primary Android client for several years, and have been happy with it for the most part. Easy to configure, not a 'resource hog' and hardly ever encounter a problem. Doesn't seem to work perfectly with Google mail (some issues with keeping my mailbox synced across devices / messages not downloading to other clients once K9 has retrieved it, despite several times checking settings) but this is minor. For me, K9s biggest strength was as a simple to use POP3 client, which has become a little diminished now that many ISPs are no longer providing / have withdrawn email services. Despite these minor criticisms, I still prefer K9 over anything else on Android. I have to agree that the new icon is terrible - it looks like the naughty Coyote that would signal my game of 'Dragon World' on a BBC computer at school was over!",82,_
I think its the best webmail client after gmail,82,_
"Wow! I Didn't Realize I Had So Much Crap In My Inbox I really love K9. I used TypeApp for quite a while and actually would recommend it above all the other email apps, except this one. Once I installed K9 and synced my mail it was so easy to see all the crap that needed to be cleaned out.  I also love the simple, some would say ""outdated"", interface. PLEASE DON'T CHANGE IT!",82,_

"Works pretty well on Pop/SMTP which my institutional webmail is using, worked better than androids default email app",82,_
"Missing support for IMAP keywords (""todo tags"") A great alternative! Made the switch because the stock e-mail client couldn't sync anything except inbox due to folder structure. But I'm hugely missing support for IMAP keywords! In order to tag from the phone and get the tags synchronised to Thunderbird and (Roundcube) webmail.",82,_

"""High battery consumption (request: disable sync on low radio signal?)Hey there,I am a long time K9 user which is using K9 for almost 5 years now. Everything is working perfectly except one thing: Battery consumption is way too high when K9 is just running in the backround.I am running 2x gmail push accounts + 2x own-mail-server imap accounts on a Nexus 6 (previously Nexus 4 and HTC Desire HD).On my large Nexus 6 screen 2hours of """"screen on time"""" is consuming as much or sometimes less battery than K9 which would run in the backround. On my Nexus4, K9 would sometimes completely drain the battery within 1 hour.My guess is that K9 is using so much battery because of low radio signals or being not connected to HSDPA?I tried creating a tasker script which would disable android auto-sync (which also stops auto-sync + push in K9) when the radio signal is low for a certain amount of time and only reactivate it when the signal is good again for a certain amount of time.Battery consumption is still high but better than before so I am wondering if K9 could get this feature out-of-the-box?I don't know what other ways are possible to minify battery consumption but K9 is, just right now as I am writing here, still using 1% more battery than my screen would use in those 30-40mins of writing (I am connected to WiFi at home or have full HSDPA+ signal while driving in thr car).For troubleshooting:I re-installed K9 several times (also on several devices). Sizes of e-mail accounts (if relevant):Gmail push #1: 114MBGmail push #2: 6MBOwn mail server imap #1: 331kb (syncs every 10 mins)Own mail server imap #2: 3MB (syncs every 10 mins)Thanks in advance !""",84,enhancement+
"Have used K9 for years and loved it.  Now, as many of you I have the sync disabled amd emails dont get pushed through unless manually do it.  I rated it a 2 in hopes that this will be fixed.  Would love to keep it over others but it has become a deal breaker.  Fixing the battery optimization has not worked.  I am on the S8+",84,_
"Always loved this app and gave it five stars, but now Push mail only works if I manually refresh.  I depend on not having to manually refresh day and night.  Had to install Bluemail, which handles Push mail beautifully.  Update: Push mysteriously started working again.  When it works, K9 is still the best.  But now I'm keeping Bluemail on my overworked phone in case K9 fails.",84,_
"During Adroid 6.01 is on Doze Mode, no new emails get received. Exclude from battery save list doesn't help. No fix?",84,_
"Sync does not seem to work with Android version 7+ on my Note 8 so it does not always automatically push emails. However I was able to find a workaround to get it to work by turning the battery optimize setting off for K9 by doing the following: 1) Go to Andriod Settings- Battery. 2) Click on the ""Battery Usage box toward the top center of the screen. 3) Click the Menu (Three vertical dots in upper right). 4)Click on Optimize Battery Usage. 5)Select ""All Apps"" from the drop down arrow at the top of the screen. 6)Scroll to K-9 Mail and toggle it Off",84,_

"Used to be the best mail app I used but it's quite buggy with Android 6+... Major bug is syncing is erratic - sometimes works, sometimes doesn't unless you disable battery optimisation for the app to exempt it from Doze. Minor bug is sometimes old read emails gets marked as unread. Some aesthetic update wouldn't hurt like some icons.",84,_
"Thought I'd have to give up on K-9 Mail after using it a long time when I got the Samsung S7. I was also getting the ""Syncing disabled"" and imap push was not working. Tried all the suggestions I read. What finally worked on this phone: settings, apps, special access, optimizing battery usage, show all apps, check k9.",84,_
"Been using K9 for some time. Use to like it. Then it quit showing new emails coming in unless I pushed(?) it. Now it won't push(?) new emails at all at any time, so I have to do it manually every time. Didn't want to give it only one star, but cannot figure out how to get this fixed. Even went into the links they ask you to try before giving it a low rating. Couldn't figure it out. May have to go to another email server.",84,_
It's a great very versatile app. The only thing I'm wondering about is it's energy consumption. It does wake the CPU quite little and also data usage is not that high compared to others. Yet it consumes quite some power. Any thoughts?,84,_
"Changing this review, as the old one was about the interface change that nearly made me quit using the app a few years ago.  Since the last update, K-9 has been draining battery like crazy.  I'm beginning to think it may have to do with the app getting stuck trying to refresh IMAP mail when there is a loss of network or network change, like changing from wireless to cellular data.   It apparently just churns away.  Side note:  I can't stand the new icon.  The older one was a bit odd and kitschy but it was comfortable and familiar.  The battery issue would get any other app a 1 or 2 star rating, but since K-9 is the only app I still use, that I used on my first android, it gets a slight pass (along with hope that it will be fixed.)",84,_
"I came looking for a secure email solution, and found a nice unexpected surprise... the ONLY email app I know of that lets you use a DARK theme. If you're like me and you do a lot of email composing and reading when you're on a BATTERY, then not having a constant WHITE background while you type is not only easier on your eyes, but on your battery life too.",84,_
Unfortunately it doesn't poll for new emails in the background even with battery optimisation disabled. Have to manually sync each account.,84,_
"Very flexible in tuning but eats the battery. Samsung S8+, while all apps are battery consumption is 0.0x, this app is 1.8",84,_
K9 was one the best mail app but Android Doze in Android 7 made it unfortunately unusable. Polling and push mails both don't work anymore even if you exclude the app from Doze. Google overdose the battery saving and K9 got killed by it. :-(,84,_
"As much use as a chocolate fireguard. With a poor data connection it just sits and spins for ages, draining the battery,  then silently gives up without reporting an error.",84,_
Ever since nougat update the app disables regular/active polling. Has to do with battery management and the doze functionality within the OS. K9 is aware but going on for several months without a solution. Probably changing apps.,84,_
I have been using this email client for years without any problems. The latest update seems to be a battery killer though. I hope they fix it soon or I will need an alternative.,84,_
"Love the features and flexibility, particularly for managing several different email accounts and being able to NOT have to use conversation view.  However, the app periodically stops working. How is that possible? Runs great for weeks, then suddenly it stops syncing. Or starts throwing authentication errors. Or, randomly hangs and consumes 30% of my battery.  I clearly don't understand app development because what should be done is the developers fix the bugs and then simply stop. Don't do anything else after that. Have a great new idea? Call it K-10 Mail and let those who need changes for the sake of changes over reliability download that.",84,_
Same problem as others here: syncing does not work correctly. Pity ... but look in the GitHub bugs: a sort of solution seems to be dialing battery optimization for K9. Waiting for a better fix.,84,_
Stopped working...no push. Been brilliant for ages but now have to go to app to get mail. Become a pain in the bum. Please fix it.,84,_
"I've found the solution to the ""syncing disabled"" issue that some people have been experiencing on Android Nougat.   On Android Nougat there are 2 processes that restrict apps and put unused processes to sleep. First is ""App Power Monitor"" which is a Samsung feature that puts apps to sleep that haven't been used or accessed for a while so they don't keep running in the background consuming unnecessary battery power and memory. This is the one that most people seem to know about and have tried but without much success. This is because there is a second, albeit very similar process that is actually causing the issue.  It's something called called ""App Optimisation"" which is a built in Google Android feature designed to put certain apps to sleep or (Dose) when the phone is locked for a certain length of time so it doesnt wake the phone up for example while you're asleep.  It is this that's actually stopping K9 Mail from syncing. I have a feeling that what is happening is, the sync process is being put to sleep after the phone has been locked for a certain amount of time but upon waking up the phone, the sync is not being switched back on again.  To solve this issue, go to Settings/Device Maintenance/Battery and click on the [Battery Usage] button next to the estimated battery life %. Now on the battery usage screen click on the top right menu and select ""Optimize Battery Usage"". Here you will see a list of apps that are not being monitored. As you will see, there is a warning message at the top of this page saying that ""optimising apps that rely on sync data may be affected"" which is a big clue why your email client might not be syncing. You will also interestingly see that the built in stock email app has by default already been made exempt (not optimised) so clearly it is not meant to be switched on for email applications. So let's go ahead and turn it off for K9 Mail.  First, click on where it says ""Apps Not Optimised"" and select ""All Apps"" from the drop down menu. Scroll down until you find K9 Mail from the list of available apps and go ahead and uncheck it. Now when you go back to the pull down menu and select the option to view 'Apps Not Optimised' you will see that K9 Mail has been added to the list of exemptions and therefore background sync will not be put to sleep.  This should resolve the issue. Since I have done this my email has been working fine.",84,_
"Very good email client! FIX FOR ""SYNCING DISABLED"" :   It's caused by your phone battery management that kills the poll. Go to your settings, search for battery management, and look for k9 and define ""ignore battery optimization for this app"". This procedure may differ with other phones but the problem is caused by this.",84,_

I've been using it since 2009 on a number of Android devices and never had any issues with the app. Extremely fast, reliable and configurable, doesn't drain battery even with the frequent push-notifications enabled, has intuitive interface, and does exactly what it has to do. K-9 Mail is also smart enough to recognize necessary settings for the majority of ISPs, making the initial setup effortless. Thank you guys for this decent open-source software.",84,_
"Battery drain I like k9, but it's a major battery drainer on the latest Android. Also according to the reports on the intarwebs I am not alone with that problem. Apparently it does let your phone go to deep sleep (wake lock and/or mobile active)",84,_
"Great email client I have used K9 for years, since my Galaxy S1 and now on my Google Pixel with Android 7.1. I did notice sync randomly being disabled on the new device and found this is due to doze (battery save) in the kernel. Once I removed the app from doze it now works great as usual and with three accounts that sync at 5,10 and 30 minute intervals only uses about 6℅ battery life in a 14 hour period. I actively use K9 throughout the day to send mail as well, usually large mail with pictures. Best by far of all clients.",84,_

"Loved this app but it suddenly started draining both data and battery. First warning was a text from my operator saying that I'd used 6GB mobile data in a couple of weeks last summer. Checked the phone and it was almost all down to K9. Disabled background data — hardly ideal —  but I was prepared to give the program another chance. Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems, only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month. At the risk of stating the obvious, this is insane! Having persevered with this for years, I've now given up, uninstalled and gained about 3 hours battery life per day. Should be removed from the Play Store.",84,_

"Usable but deficient K9 may be the best mailer on android, but that's a low bar, and the main reason I only use the phone or tablet for really urgent stuff. Not having hierarchical folder views is a throwback to the pre Unix days, not made for serious users. Also, K9 frequently hangs until some timeout, taking ages to pull in mail (I don't use push mail). Forcing stop and restarting makes it work normally again (for a while).",84,_

"Good email app; battery drain As an e-mail app for Android, I love K-9. It's flexibility means you can do anything you want (I never hit limits), and the UI is intuitive and easy to work with.  However: I recently noticed my phone was draining its battery too fast. I did some tests, fully charging the phone, rebooting it, leaving K-9 open in the background to pick up my emails, but reading them with another app I wanted to try out. 10 hours later, K-9 had run up one hour of ""keep awake"" time (even though I hadn't opened the app once - it was all background) and the other app (that I'd used throughout the day) just 9 minutes. So I disabled K-9, but the ""keep awake"" time kept increasing one minute in ten, so some background process was obviously thrashing the CPU.  The next day, phone rebooted, K-9 disabled - the phone is cooler to touch and its charge lasted the full day. I don't know which update introduced the problem, but at some point K-9 has started using too much battery, where other apps (used in the same way) have not.  I like the app enough to return to it - after some more upgrades, especially if they mention battery issues - I'll probably give it another try.",84,_

Incoming Message Master! Alright this app is amazing it's great for Whovian ' s and it's great for people who get tons of mail no complaints it's just perfect,90,_
"Great Hi, devs, I would like to see a feature that Aqua Mail has: remember sender so that program always downloads entire message! Please add this!",90,_
Stopped working Hasn't updated my inbox in days and days. Can still send tho..,90,_
Downgraded from 4 stars to 2 Have been using K9 for years but I hate the new update. Now it works just like Google mobile Mail which I don't use. Why would I need all these colored boxes with the first initial of the sender? How the heck is that helpful? It's very confusing and unnecessary. Looking for another client asap.,90,_
"Simple, feature-rich, fast, attractive & free I really don't think this could get much better, works like a charm, looks great, and never lets me down. :-)",90,_
Google has abandoned users of older android versions. Your app is really good features which are usually seen in latest version of Gmail.,90,_
"Best mail client K-9 is a great, feature rich, powerful mail client.  The UI is still a little clunky though.",90,_
"Great Like others have mentioned, a few tweaks such as being able to delete multiple mails would make this an outstanding mailer. But even without, it's a great app, very happy with it.",90,_
Was great...now it's not!! Used to be able to click a check box & delete a bunch of email at once.  Now that feature is gone.  Why would you remove a helpful productivity tool?  Is it because of a conflict of interest...interested in advertisers getting their mail opened by me instead of providing me with a useful product.  Does Google own K9 now???,90,_
Great Way better than Google's default. Doesn't waste wake and cpu time.,90,_
"K9 IN...Google OUT! After the horrible face lift to the Gmail app that is equal to the tragic face lifts of many hollywood stars I wanted to say thanks for a great email app.  K-9 Mail is straight to the point, easy to setup and use...and it lets me know when I have mail RIGHT AWAY!!  It's great!!!!  Thanks for saving me from the Gmail monopoly!  I've been using it now for about a week and it works great!  Updates in sync on a snap.  Perfect app!",90,_
"Great Email Client The stock android email app isn't brilliant. This one however does everything I need and more besides. It's a great app. Many thanks.  My only, very minor gripes, are that sometimes it's not clear what some of the icons mean (getting better with new releases). The archiving feature (which I don't use) can be VERY frustrating if accidentally clicked on. Please give an option to disable this feature. Lastly I get why you chose the icon but could we have the option of one that looks like an email app please.",90,_
K9 Mail Great email app.,90,_
My favorite email client While not perfect it has grown on me. Google's stock email client is like all other Google apps - TOTAL JUNK!  This however works and your late update has proven to be a good one. Now your user interface is top notch. Excellent improvements. I love it!,90,_
amazing app like it,90,_
"Was better, now not so much The ""old"" K-9 mail was great, and reliable.  The ""new"" one however has a lot of bugs, the most irritating being the one where you view a message and get a blank page.   I like the new interface..it's more like GMail and yet it has adopted some of the more irritating features of the ""new"" GMail (like the icons).  I hope that they fix the ""blank message"" bug soon because it is really getting on my nerves.",90,_
Microsoft Exchange supportK9 mail is the best email apps i've ever tried but it doesnt support Exchange version >10 which is my main email account. it would be my deepest appreciation if any developer can help on this. Thank you very much in advance.1.2.3.K-9 Mail version:Android version:Account type,91,enhancement+
Best email client!,91,_
Simply the best mobile email client I have used. And I have tried many.  Update: I like the new icon!!,91,_
Best Android email client I have used. Works flawlessly.,91,_
"I went through all best email apps for android. If you're fan of Thunderbird, then K9 is the only one best email app for you.",91,_
"I've been using K9 for years. I have seven email accounts and it handles them all flawlessly. Overall, one of the best and most used apps on my phone.",91,_
The best Android MUA,91,_
The best mail client,91,_
Didnt connect to exchange.  Needs work.,91,_
"Been using​ it since the very beginning of Android and while I've often looked around, this still remains the best email app for Android. Everything available for free, highly customizable and it's open source to top it off. Easy 5/5.",91,_
Possibly a good app if it was dragged out of the stone age. Exchange 2010 is only 7 years old so far but unusable on this app - gotta be taking the piss,91,_
Brilliant email app. Recent updates fixed the few bugs it had... it's now working perfectly for me. Certainly the best email app for multiple accounts that I've used.,91,_
I've used K9 email for quite a while and I am very satisfied with the performance that I have received it's a very useful app thank you.,91,_
One of the best IMAP clients I've ever used.,91,_
"Must have, i used this mail apps and can handle 2,7gb of email and still going",91,_
"This app definitely is one of the more feature rich and advanced email apps out there! I can actually do what I need to with this, unlike all the ""simple"" and ""elegant"" apps.",91,_
Used to be best mail app... Now it's so annoying and often makes my mail account locked,91,_
Best mail client,91,_
Best free software for mail,91,_
Simple but powerful! The best email client.,91,_
Best email client for android,91,_
Best email client I've used so far I tested over 10,91,_
Best email app for Android I've tried many apps for email client on Android but K9 is f**kin' awesome and unbeatable.,91,_
"Best Email client for Android Probably not the most beautiful one, but it's the most customisable one, very open and flexible.",91,_
The best Still love k9 mail. I have been using it for 10 years and 5 different phones.,91,_
"I'd like to use it but... Seems it doesn't want to accept my works email exchange account. Keeps saying a valid url for the exchange account could not be found. It's funny because plenty of other email apps don't have a problem. And why are the time and date on the emails so far behind the actual time and date? Get it sorted, K9!",91,_
"Doest Work with exchange Tried the app on my nexus 7 for my work exchange mails, but it failed to work. Could not find server even though the settings work fine with lots of other mail clients.  Surprised that this highly rated app struggles to do automatically find ones exchange account and set it up accordingly. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.",91,_
Powerful and simple and free Best email client I've found hands down. It has a bunch of features other don't (like identities) and has a lot of nice customization,91,_
Too bad A decent little app and seems to have a good community of supporters. But being unable to sync Exchange subfolders is a deal-breaker for me.,91,_
Doesn't accept exchange server Keeps saying the URL is not valid although it works with every other Android mail app I've tried do far...,91,_
"Exchange Support? The UI could be modernised as well. It appeals to the open source, PGP/GPG market, and that's why I still happily use the app! Just wish I could use all my accounts with it.",91,_
Best email client I've used so far I tested over 10,91,_
"At last! I use my tablet for traveling, hence I want things to be relatively simple, not to interfere with apps/programs on my main computer, and to be easy and quick while I'm on the road.   Other apps just tried to do too much and did little well.  I had resigned myself to only using web-based apps (what to do when, as I often am, out of WiFi contact)😟  Thank you for K-9!",91,_
Much better than factory mail client I love that you can store messages on the SD card as I was running out of memory on the device storage. I have Exchange sync perfectly an IMAP account and also Gmail and everything works perfectly. For people having issues with Exchange Google which URL you are supposed to use.,91,_
The Best Great app.,91,_
Simply the best email client for Android.  Leaves you in control of your email.,91,_
"Best. 2nd device so far I like K9,  it's so far the best app for multiple accounts and with no single ad! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! It take some time to figure it how it works, but when you get it, it's a piece of cake. My second device so far with it. I tried on this one some newer email aps, like BlueMail, but they have lots of ads, and pop ups for comercials, so I got the old one, old but gold K9, and I'm in piece now. K9 is maybe a litle complicated, and maybe look outdated, but it's all crap.  THIS APP RULZ!",91,_
"Use it all the time They do have the very best!  Some time ago,  K9 blew it for lollipop and I  had to give bad rating.  I then tried 5 apps highly rated but none measured up.  Over many months all is well!",91,_
The best for old school email lovers,91,_
"My favourite mail client If you make a paid version and add exchange functionality, I would buy it  in a heartbeat.",91,_
"Great app, lacks Exchange Support Used this app for a year now, overall it's great but it does not work with Microsoft exchange.",91,_
"Great email client for Android This is the best email app I've found so far. Easy to setup and navigate. And best of all, no ads.",91,_
Best mail client,91,_
Best mail program for android,91,_
Best ever mail client.,91,_
Can't open my exchange email,91,_
My main mail program I have been using k9 for years it is the best mail program out there,91,_
Best yet Best emailer for my Galaxy Tab S2. No glitches. Love it!,91,_
"Best Email app for Android Very reliable, easy to customise. Highly recommended.",91,_
The best e-mail apps,91,_
"Best email client Been using this for years, the only one that opens every format I need. Hail to the developer!",91,_
Best is best. The most feature complete mail client for Android.,91,_
"Very good! I try many different apps. This one is the best. It have all what I need. Could be more ""pretty"" but it's ok.",91,_
Does not work with Hotmail. Like so many other mail clients. Microsoft...,91,_
"Best for a reason Faster than any other app, much easier to use than any other. I tested almost all mail apps for Android but keep going back to K-9",91,_
"Best mail client for Android The design of the app looks somewhat old-fashioned and the configuration menu structure is more complicated than I would like it to be, but all things considered this is by far the best email client available for Android. I've tried Gmail, and liked it too, but unfortunately that app cannot send plain text messages! Can you believe it? K9 won't give you that kind of trouble. Also, I believe it's the only email client for Android that supports IMAP IDLE .",91,_
take best email app and destroy it last version is simply useless.,91,_
Simply the best If you like your email a little old school such as a Outlook than you will love this app. There's much less of Randomness than Gmail and it's easy to control every aspect of this program. Thank you for a great app,91,_
Great Best email program out there,91,_
Best of the many I've tried .......but still room for improvement,91,_
Best mail app Best mail app used so far. Still use gmail app to search my mail.,91,_
Still ... Not working with Exchange Tried to add Exchange account. Error cannot connect to server. IOException.,91,_
"Not the only app that does exchange anymore Well now that the big g does exchange, don't see any reason to be using third party apps for email anymore. Ok app, but better ones out there.",91,_
"Fails exchange, clumsy Unable to setup account with Exchange. Clumsy.",91,_
"This is the best email client. IMAP and POP3 support. No ads. In several ways, K9 Mail is superior to higher rated email apps.",91,_
"Awesome email client Better power consumption than other mail clients, and handles conversations well. Only issue is how it handles exchange accounts, but I can use it as an IMAP client for exchange.",91,_
"NOT the best email app for android. In fact not even better than stock. So many times i've tried k9 mail now and came back disappointed every time. It crashes randomly, is impossible to set up with Exchange and does not even properly support Push! The app boasts to be best android email app but in fact is not even better than the stock android mail client. Quite the contrary! In stock client you just enter MS Exchange email address and password, done. Not so in k9! Maybe one day when k9 mail does not suck I'll give it 5 stars. Until then,  1 star for repeatedly wasting my time.",91,_
k9-Mail app does not have Exchange Active Sync Support. I liked the App but no Activesync... Can't Use it,91,_
Best Android mail client I've used k-9 for over 3 years on 4 phones and it still remains very practical. No unneeded bells and whistles.,91,_
"Best mail app For  me the best mail app. Stable, perfect.",91,_
The best I've tried several and this is the only email app I will use. Even supports Exchange.,91,_
Perfect mail client. If your looking for a mobile mail client and aren't sure what to choose this one is the way to go. It evens supports that Microsoft Exchange rubbish our company uses.,91,_
Best free mail app by a mile.,91,_
Pour exchange support. Deal killer...,91,_
Doesnt show a single email,91,_
"The best Isn't perfect, but is the best",91,_
I love it! The best client mail for android,91,_
Still the best after all these years!!! That says it all!,91,_
"Best Android Email App I've used K-9 Mail for several years on four devices.  It is reliable, and offers the flexibility of customizable options to meet almost anyone's needs. It is the only email app I have used that I haven't replaced.",91,_
Best Email App This is one of the best Email apps on android. .I can even get microsoft exchange on it.  The only problem I am having is getting Microsoft Outlook to work on it.   Also I wish it had widgets.  Probably should have given it 5 stars.,91,_
"Best Email app! And I've tried a lot! This is a very customizable email app that does everything you want from an email app.  I didn't love it the first time I tried it, but after spending a few minutes setting it up the way I want it, I realize it's the best email app available!  Keep up the good work! It would be nice if there was a local folder where emails could be saved and not lost when it's not in the most recent 25/50/...",91,_
Cannot setup Exchange account The same configuration works for the others but not this app. I don't know why.,91,_
Look and feel is outdated now... ...but even after 4 years use it is still the best organised mail client I've seen.,91,_
"One of the best Android mail apps! Although it isn't perfect, it comes far closer than any other Android mail app I'm aware of.",91,_
"Best email app I've used. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I have used several email apps and this appears to be one of the best, if not the best. Keep up the great work. Much better than the system email app on my LG G4.",91,_
K9mail This is one of the best email apps out there. Works fine for me.,91,_
Best on the market Hands down the best email client on the market.,91,_
Best mail client Very customisable,91,_
No exchange 2010 support.,91,_
"Still Doesn't work with Microsoft Exchange Server It's a great app, Ans works great with tasker. But despite of various configurations and settings, I still can't connect to my Microsoft Exchange server account. It simply doesnt connect. Shows some kind of I/O error. Whenever i try to poll a specific folder, it results in ""IOException: Error with cod"".  Please provide a solution to this.",91,_
Very good Best email client for Android,91,_
Best email client Use it,91,_
Best mail app ever. Loving it already,91,_
Great app Perfect mail app. I hope someday it will support exchange properly.,91,_
Great email app One of the best I've ever used.,91,_
Best I've Found I use it instead of Gmail. Very solid app.,91,_
Love it! I've tried all of the other email  apps and K9 is the best. Beats the default Android email app hands down!,91,_
Best mail client Powefull and light. Only missing part is support for Exchange 2010 😢. Hope will be sorted out very soon.,91,_
"A wonderful email app It's a great daily driver, but I find that it doesn't play well with every Exchange server. It worked great at my university's, but poorly with my employer's. I love it for my personal e-mail though. Improve Exchange support and add MIME/PGP for five stars.",91,_
"Best email client. Classic interface, customizable. Had to move from gmail and android default mail after they started their ""conversations"" nonsense.",91,_
Best one I've found A few issues. It appears to stall often on gmail and requires killing and restarting before it will finally pickup mail from the account,91,_
Perfect ! One of the best email client ! Please provide ActiveSync support.,91,_
I've used this mail app for every android I've owned. Best one ever!,91,_
"Simply the best mobile email client I've ever used.Take a bit of time to configure then, it's wonderful.",91,_

best email client on android,91,_
The best mail app,91,_
Fantastic! Best android email app. Love it!,91,_
"The best I've tried other clients and al be it they look pretty but they all have one problem,  they lack functionality,  I have not come across another program yet where I can pull up the headers. Sure you get a senders name but that's it, where's the detail, where did this email originate from? And that's the problem with every other program I've tried.",91,_
"Best mail app By far the best mail app. Works with every email service I've tried. Rarely has issues, and is usually caused by poor handling of existing connection issues.",91,_
Best The best email app,91,_
"Now on my S4, of course!  Perfect best third party app for mail",91,_
Missing the exchange sync Served me well but now I need exchange sync as well.,91,_
"Best mail app. Better even than the factory Android app, or official apps from providers as Gmail and Hotmail.",91,_
Fantastic Faultless app. Why can't all apps be this good?,91,_
Simply the best email client for android. The developers have really put great effort into creating a useful and powerful email app with more features and options than any other I've seen.,91,_
"Superb It might not be the prettiest but it's the best, and no shopping list of permissions to grant either.",91,_
"Great email app, need more user flexibility n control One of the best email apps available, but too many unnecessary permissions.  USB storage? I'm not rooted nor carrying any OTG.  START AT STARTUP: Even Microsoft give more control.  I love it, my battery hates it.  I'll keep an eye on the change log and decide what to do.",91,_
The Best By far the best and most complete mail app I have come across. The ease of use and the ability to customize every little detail makes an unbeatable combo.,91,_
Great App I love this email app.  I've tried them all and this is the best. Wish I could print emails though. Works well with my Samsung gear unlike other apps.  I would recommend  this to anyone.,91,_
I've tried them all.. K9 email is the best and most dependable for IMAP and POP3. The only thing missing is exchange functionality. Perhaps one day someone will use K9 as a base and extend it to have exchange functionality.,91,_
"Best e-mail app I tried on Android Unlike most email apps, K-9 actually provides support for Drafts.",91,_
Perfect best mail app,91,_
The best Easier features,91,_
Best mail app,91,_
"Excellent Application with Great Functionality. After a morning of searching and infuriating failures of other apps, I came to K9. I tried Google, Outlook, and all the others. I even tried some payware. None of them came anywhere close to matching the functionality and ease-of use/setup as K9. Where Microsoft and Google have failed, a group of independent developers have succeeded. Thank you guys for having brains and the ability to use them.   Now if we can just get the icon changed... Honestly it was the silly, superficial reason I didn't come here first.",91,_
Best of the bunch After having tried out all major Android e-mail clients and some minor ones I am back at K9.,91,_
Best email app I've tried others but always come back to K9,91,_

tried the rest returned to the best best featured email for android... until i saw new version has removed check boxes. with maybe 10 junk emails in every mail check i dont have time to open and delete individually. put it back how it was please. until them ill be looking for another client again.,91,_
"Best email app out there! This is the best of all the email apps I have tried. It doesn't seem to have a limit to how many accounts you can use and set up all of them very easily. My only complaint if any, and I acknowledge it's a small stupid one, is the icon. It doesn't reflect what a great business tool this is.",91,_
"possibly the best mail app Well, after testing a dozen(at the very least) of the most popular  mail apps, it seems this alongside the default mail app is the best. Not because it's ""great"" (it's not) but because of lack of true competition...",91,_
"Best email client Switched from stock exchange client into K9 two months ago. The best client out there. Easy but powerful, customization is superior.",91,_
"best You may want to try a lot of mail apps, but you will stay with this one.",91,_
"MOTO X user 4/3/14 I just switched from a flip phone and iPod touch to the Moto. When I setup my exchange account, the app told me that my server REQUIRES me to allow it full access and control over MY phone. Bye bye. K-9 was setup in about a minute and a half, didn't need to allow access to any of MY personal information, and the interface looks to be well thought out and user friendly. I especially like the ""split screen in landscape view"". Granted, I haven't looked around that much, but this app works perfectly for me, so I'm done looking, on to better things. I don't even care that Gmail isn't supported. Great job, guys! Update 4/15/14: Gmail is supported but I ran into some problems when I decided to change settings on my Exchange account. Basically, every change I made caused some function to fail. Display, sync, notification problems got worse and worse until finally the app was beginning to make me feel stupid, so I uninstalled and moved on to a paid app. Regular IMAP/POP email is OK, but needs more work in order to use Exchange accounts.",91,_

"Needs Exchange, but that's it. Just needs Microsoft Exchange support, and this so would be the catch all end all for email.",91,_
This app is great! I get a lot of mail and this app has been absolutely the best at helping me manage it.   There is so much flexibility with the options that it just makes me smile whenever I open it up.  This app has everything I'm looking for in a email client!   Thank you for making this available.,91,_
"The best The best email app I have tried.. I keep going back to K9. The interface could use some improvement, and rich text editing would be nice. Still it is the standard for Android email.",91,_
Works great I think this is one of the best mail app I've used for a while to manage non Gmail accounts. It's especially great if you have more than one email account to manage.,91,_
"Good E Mail client, not best for exchange This is a good e mail client for most of the EMail purpose. However, limited signature customisation and no contact sync with server makes it less useful exchange client for me. Would love to give five star when these two updates are available in future.",91,_
"Does not work with Exchange 2010 I downloaded this for my work email and while I'm sure it's a fine email app, I couldn't test it because Exchange 2010 doesn't have WebDAV which is required to run this app. They probably should tell you this in the description.",91,_

OK for POP3 but not Exchange 404 Error when configuring Exchange yet the stock app works fine. This seems common. Would have been three stars for the POP3 except the wiki links dont work so no help to be had. Seems like this app has had its day when the stock apps are better. Shame.,91,_
The BEST! I have tried many other Android email clients on my HTC phone and Nook tablet and most leave me up short....but K-9 is the best I have had in 4 years and it allows multiple accounts and it is simple to use. It just plain works!!  Try it and you'll abandon the rest.  Thanks!   (BW),91,_
"No need to search any further! Greatest Mail prgm ever! These programmers are composed of people who have the true heart of opensource.

Thank you folks!",91,_
"Still no exchange support Such a fantastic client. Unfortunately, Microsoft got rid of WebDAV in exchange and K9 will no longer work.",91,_
Wow! KitKat support in 3 days Back to being the best,91,_
"This is really a great app This app should be at the top of the list of great apps for Android. The developer knows what's up, keeps it up to date and continues to support it. Email via this client works like a breeze, any type of email account can be handled by this app.",91,_
"Nice app but NO Exchange support I liked K-9 and was looking forward to using it, but couldn't. I use Gmail, yahoo and for work Exchange.  While I could successfully connect K-9 to Gmail and Yahoo, it does not connect and work with corp Exchange.  It is unfortunate the app description doesn't openly state this and in fact has a false claim about Exchange support in its description.  It would be a great app if Exchange was supported.  Does anyone know the real scoop on its exchange support?",91,_

"Could be better & easier! I manage figuring out how to add 2nd email account, but it wasn't easy. Not that this app does work on a Nexus 7 running Android Lollypop (5.0.2).

"Allows disabling of 'conversation view'..THANK YOU!! Every since the last Android 5 update Gmail will only allow emails grouped in conversations.

Great App! One suggestion. You could create different smtp server setting for wifi and mobile connections with auto selection. This would make a lot of people's life with private domains easier on ee network for example. Great app!,92,_
"Average This used to be my favourite mail app. The recent colour explosion has made it visually unappealing for me, and worse yet, there is no way to opt out of the rainbow.

My default email for years So much better than the standard android one.   Just installed the latest (free) version and haven't found any issues yet.  My only gripe is the limited  attachment feature. You can only add from Gallery or Music.  Why not add a browse button so I can find a PDF or something? The workaround is to be viewing the item then share with K9 but that's no good if I'm already eolying to a mail!,92,_

This allows for optimisation of SMTP network traffic### Expected behaviourWe should change the behaviour of `sendMessageTo` to use pipelining to reduce round-trip-delay when we receive the PIPELINING extension.### Actual behaviourRegardless of PIPELINING extension status we always wait for each response### Developer notesThe hard part here will be implementing SMTP command handle for asynchronous responses. Likely a queue of outstanding responses will need to be maintained.There's ample opportunity for testing here - the SmtpTransportTest code allows you to provide dummy responses from an SMTP Server. There should be tests written for:* Using pipelining when it is enabled* Ensuring pipelining is not tried when it is not enabled* Ensuring that we wait for all responses to pipelined operations before considering the message sent* Ensuring that we handle failures to one or more pipelined operations properly (and still read the remaining pipeline responses)The RFC contains examples for much of these: . 1.

Much better battery life than using two mail apps! Switched to K-9 after thorough internet research to consolidate a corporate Exchange and Gmail account onto one app. I had been using the stock app on Droid Mini for Exchange and the Gmail app for my personal Gmail.  I like the K-9 interface since it's an easy transition from the similar Gmail app.  I am impressed with huge improvement in battery use on my phone since switching over.  I have the Exchange set to push (as it was before on stock) and Gmail polling at 15 min intervals and it's been much better than when I used two separate mail apps.

Hope to see this change reverted. Thanks",113,_
Latest update causing problems I've been using app for years. Loved it. Now deleted emails don't clear from db. Database just continues to grow. Will have to find new email app. Too bad.,113,_
I've been using it for three or four years now. Love it. Great mail app.,113,_
"Update made it unusable - January 2017 Edit - Email doesn't download anymore, and it DESTROYS my battery now. Please fix this or simply pull the update.                                                          The stock Android email client was giving me fits receiving email. This free solution cured my problems and seems to work better overall. Love it.",113,_
Poor after update Was great till recent update that crashes its database. Some emails that can be opened previously now not able to.. now even manual fetching of email become so slow and sometimes hang... :-(,113,_
"Stuck on database upgrade screen Roll back the update, until you have a working release. This is pretty unacceptable. If I don't see a fix or some sort of announcement indicating you are working on a fix, I'm done with this app. Worked fine for years. Now it's useless and I am most worried I have lost information I keep no where else. Shame on me for that. But greater shame on you. I'll never fully trust your app again.",113,_
More update issues Was a great mail app until the latest update (been using it for several years). Can no longer zoom messages on any of my samsung devices which is a proper pain in the .... and very 'laggy' along with most of what others have said.. PLEASE rolll back untill this update has been tested better.,113,_
Layout problem on update Been using K9 since 2011. Great app. Recent update changed email layout so that attachments are at bottom of thread now. Much better at top of email. Easier to access and notice at top. Please return to top!,113,_
January 1st 2017 update is a stinker After the update the app is completely useless. I cannot receive or delete email.,113,_
I used to love this app Was working great till last android update. No longer auto fits to screen. Lost ability to enlarge email. Please fix,113,_
"Last update disabled my mail Since the last update my mail continually says it is updating the database for my account, as though it is stuck in a loop. I've lost (at least for now) all of my email.",113,_
Great email app Works well. Have been using for years. Can setup up multiple ways to access email.,113,_
"Dev has lost the plot. Using too much storage, and the database update did not finish, even overnight.",113,_
"used to be my favorite apps, but since last update i've got lost all my starred email from my inbox and unable to find it in any folder. It just dissapear. The only option to get it back is to resend those emails from another device or create new email account and search it one by one from my thousands mails and it will happen again soon",113,_
"Best email Great app using it since years, just got prefect, please add recipients history when composing emails",113,_
"New update After new update, the attachments are the bottom. I've to swipe more than 15times before I can reach down there. Pls revert back to top. Thks.",113,_
The only great email app Nothing else compares. Remove and disable any other email apps K9_mail is All you need.,113,_

Excellent. I've used it for years.,113,_
Favourite email app Excellent email app! I've used this for several years now on a few devices and it always performs perfectly.,113,_
Great email client with good functionality. The only onre problem - UI looks obsolete. And I hope developers will update it in future versions.,113,_
"Good program It's got to be one of the best e-mail clients for Android. I originally replaced Google Mail with K9 on my Tablet. Since the last update, though, it's refusing to send half of my emails. I just get them placed in my outbox, and permanently stuck there. A pity as it's otherwise a good program.",113,_
"Great Using for years now, thanks!",113,_
I have been using for over 3 years and it is great!,113,_
"Old school and cool! I've tried a few email clients over the years, PC and smart phone, and this is by far my preferred mobile email client.

Great app! I've been using this app on multiple devices for years with only a few issues. Fantastic.,113,_
"Great mail client I've been using k9 for several years now, run 3 emails on it, without any issues. - download mails once and read them offline",113,_
"Very powerful, but... I've used k9 for years. I've connected all 6 of my email accounts. I've managed an email/web server for the past 21 years. This was the best I've used. However I'm on Nexus devices only now so I get the latest & greatest updates when they become available. It's been three months now and the certificate issues I only see with k9 are not fixed. So even though my overall rating should be five stars, I'm uninstalling and dropping my rating. Besides, the gmail app now does much of what I used k9 for so...",113,_

I've compacted the database, deleted trash emails, nothing works to speed this up anymore. Please fix it.",113,_
"Used to be great. Needs updating. I have used K-9 for a number of years. It previously worked wonderfully. However, it now constantly freezes and crashes.

Used to be great but not good lately I have used this app for my email for years and it was really good until a few months ago.  Since then the performance has been terrible and it crashed multiple times per day.  Even doing something as simple as opening an email.  This week it has stopped showing new emails.  I get notifications that I have new email but when I open the app the newest message in my inbox is from 5 days ago.  Please fix these issues or I will have to continue using another app.,113,_

"Used to be great now doesn't work at all This was a great email app until it was updated, now ""it appears to have stopped working"" which is rubbish.

Issues sense last update Great app (normally) and I use it for years but sense  last update I keep getting Errors sending emails from my ipage email accounts . This is normally a 5 star app but not anymore... waiting for a quick  fix,113,_
"Worked well, now garbage Since the last update, I've been getting certificate errors. It's not the host. Based on what I'm seeing here, other puerile are having the same problem. Unable to securely send or receive makes this app useless, sadly.",113,_
"Was great until update Excellent until last update. Now it will not receive new email, and manual loading take forever. Usually times out!",113,_
Functional but.... Tried it due to having at least 4 email accounts and want something to wrap it all in one. Just can't find a way to like it. Not sold on the layout and really hate the polling deal for notifications. I've legitimately lost emails when I should have at a certain time. Just can't do it. Probably good for others though.,113,_
Doesn't auto download anymore I've had this on all my phones and loved it. Installed it on my new Galaxy Light and it won't auto download emails. This has caused me to miss some important emails.I've tried emailing them but they don't respond.,113,_

If theres nothing wrong dont change it Have had no problems for the better part of 2 years and now ive installed the update i cant send emails. Why cant people just leave things alone??????,113,_
"thanks for breaking your app since the update yesterday, i am unable to send mail.  i've re-entered my password, i've tried every version of accepting (or not) certificates and encrypting (or not).  you have made your app pointless.

Broken since last update Have loved this app since I discovered it but the last app update has made it useless. Says outgoing settings are wrong so won't send nothing. I've not changed it and double checked. Please fix asap.,113,_
"Latest update causing issues Ever since the update I get daily errors about an invalid certificate. But if I go to the account screen and connect, all is fine.   The really odd thing, is that K-9 has NO option to accept any certificate. All implementations of OpenSSL allow you to accept any cert and encrypt the channel - K-9 should have this, and just ignore any potential errors. I am not worried about a MitM attack, so just quit nagging me - or if there is a real error, tell me what it is.",113,_
"Horrible I've used this app for years, until the last update. Totally messed up my email, I can no longer use this app for anything. If it ain't broke don't mess with it. Had to uninstall. Fix please.",113,_

New update is crap. Please fix,113,_
Please fix Not working since update!!!,113,_
New update broke the app! Great email client is now an incessant torrent of error messages. Had to force close. Worthless until a fix is done.  Galaxy S4,113,_
"Please fix. Latest update has ruined a great app. Now saying ""next poll 2 days ago"" and not fetching mail at all!! Was perfect before this!",113,_
Great mail client and one of the most reliable apps I've come across. Thanks,113,_
Great email app. Much better than stock samsung email apps,113,_

"Great app till last update Since last update, unable to launch app. And even FC while in the background.",113,_
"Works great! I've been using K-9 Mail for a couple years now and really like it. It handles my roaming (offline) well, saving replies & drafts for later, integrates w/multiple IMAP ACCTS, etc. It just works! And is very configurable (business/fun/private accts, etc).",113,_
"Update broke the app This app no longer opens on my samsung galaxy note since the last update. It just has a black screen for a few seconds and then closes back to my home screen. Please fix this or i have to uninstall...Update! Reinstalling fixed the problem, works perfect now.",113,_
"There is no competition! I tried aquamail, solmail, maildroid... Simply said: there is no competition!  thanks for this great app",113,_

"Really easy Hated email handler as standard on my s3, K9 just works.  And for deleting email as check box has gone simply swipe across the email heading  and the trash can appears bottom left,  this works for multiple email deletions.",113,_
Wow wow wow. just about beats any other android email client out there. It looks fresh and feels extremely stable! The latest up date is just mindblowing.,113,_
"Awesome I've loved this app for a long time but the new update just sealed it. It works great, makes all my emails work together perfectly.  Beautiful tiles too",113,_
"Was great until last update I've used K-9 for over a year and it's always been awesome.  Very customizable, and I love the quiet time setting which allows you to silence it during certain hours of the day.  Since the most recent update, however, there have been many problems.  The app no longer notifies me when I have new mail on my Gmail account; I have to open up the app and look.  Even worse, it's draining my battery like crazy.  Please fix or I'll have to uninstall!",113,_
"Great email client, but... love this email client and been using it for a couple of years now, but after the last update, I need to kill the app and restart it everytime I need to check for new emails. Would REALLY appreciate a fix (using a Samsung Galaxy S4 and IMAP on SmarterMail latest version)",113,_
"Was great, but I'm searching for a new email app now Over the last month it's crashed more and more. This week, it crashes when I try to move an email to another folder. Also, after I send an email and go to the next message the new message doesn't show. Just the header does. This looks like an old issue that's resurfaced. Really making it unusable. I love the app. Just wondering if deleting and reinstalling will fix it. All the other apps I've tried this week are lacking the awesomeness of this one.",113,_
No problems I've been using this app for 3 years,113,_
Great App Great app I've been using it for years.  Always reliable and works great.,113,_
"Since update my checkboxes don't work. I can select all or none, but can't choose just the ones I need. Please fix!	Great app, but much more reliable than the stock email on my Captivate. Consistently downloads my Comcast AND Yahoo mail on 3G or WiFi.",113,_
"""update"" someone's idea of improvement Seriously?  The latest update is just crap.  Never has so little been billed as so much.  Did someone actually think this was an improvement?  Not.  Update - more and more updates, and clearly ignoring the feedback of others.  It just keeps getting less user friendly with every ""update"".  Developer's reply, ""you can download the old versions""  Seriously?",113,_
"Nexus 5 issue temp fix If you have a nexus 5 with KitKat 4.4 and your messages are blank, disable auto fit in global settings.  Great free email solution overall. Don't give a 1 star just because a new version of OS broke something, and you've been using it perfectly for years. That's not fair.",113,_
"Great email program, but problems on Nexus 5 with Kit Kat I've been using this email client since the T-Mobile G1 days, and it's always been excellent.  I've tried a few others, but always revert back to K-9.   My favorite feature is the support for IMAP IDLE, providing push email support.  The only improvement I could think of that this app could use would be support for S/MIME encryption.   I've been able to use Djigzo to send and view encrypted emails, but it's a clumsy solution.  Having it integrated into K-9 would be perfect.",113,_
"Just keeps getting even better I've been using this app for three generations of android, currently running under KitKat on a nexus 7 and moto g. As a single email client managing five different email accounts, it's smooth and very effective.",113,_
not the biggest 4.x fan but still great k9 has been my favourive email app for years now as it provides just what i need: a highly configurable und compact imap email app without any bloated crap functionality. i've had so me issues after upgrading to 4.x initially but got everything smoothed out so far...,113,_
"Dreadfully slow since update It has become almost unusable on both my Nexus 7 and samsung galaxy s3. I've tried the recreate data fix,  but still same issues.",113,_
Cool email client app Great app so far using a day. I was tired of using galaxy s4 default email client which gave me hard time coz of reloading deleted messages and when refreshed the old mails popped up as unread. This app seems work great so far.,113,_
"""Email Notifications on Android WatchI love K-9 mail and love my new LG Urbane. I correctly get notifications for new email on the watch but when I select to delete it, the confirm delete notification pops up on the phone. So it is not possible to complete the entire delete email operation from the watch.This works correctly with the Gmail application but it doesn't have a confirm delete prompt. I suppose one option would be to disable the confirm delete dialog entirely or to disable it for just the phone.Working out the most desirable behavior for using a watch to dispatch the email is the first step. I have only had this watch a few weeks and am still getting used to it. K-9 I have used for a couple of years and am very happy with. AndroidWear is just a brave new world to figure out the Right Thing To Do (tm). :)""",114,enhancement+
"Updating score from 2 to 5.  All bugs that I experienced have been ironed out. Much better email client than the original on my Sammy Notetab. I love the new icon it's better than the previous. Very modern design, love it. Happy New Year all.",114,_
Love this mail client. But what have the devs been smoking when choosing this new icon? Please revert to the old one.,114,_
Love the app. Don't love the new icon.,114,_
Love this app. Perfect for handling multiple email accounts on the phone without any of the hassle that most of the other apps bring with them.,114,_
"I really love this app, it keeps all my email accounts in one place which helps keep up with the daily. I have been using it for a while and on a couple of different devices, but the new icon really sucks. I'd love to have the old one back, that would make it perfect and worth all five stars to me, since the icon was much cleverer and more befitting of the inspiration and this app. Thanks.",114,_
Used for years on old phone. Have new phone on android 7 now no notifications despite reinstalling,114,_
"Love it! Simple, plain, small just for me",114,_
"Great email client. I love the configurability of the message list. Preview lengths, gravatars etc. Works flawlessly with OpenKey-chain for email encryption.",114,_
I love the efficiency of K9 Email,114,_
I love that i can set custom notifications and can delete all 3000 emails at once. I also love the easiness of maneuvering through it. EDIT: after Nougat i can no longer rely on K9 as syncing somehow seems to be disabled. I've been missing a lot of important emails due to it. Had to uninstall,114,_
Have been using this simple but well-crafted and quick email app for several years and find it most handy on the Android phone. The price is right too (grin).,114,_
"Great, works good with GMX. I love it,!",114,_
"Won't delete emails from the servers anymore. I delete an email from my phone but when I go to my email online they're all still there. Also, won't delete from the pop up anymore either. 🙁",114,_
"Used on S3mini for 3 years, S4mini 3 years,  now S5mini, Works well on all.  Shame no 'Swipe to Delete' tho'.",114,_
"I used to love this app but last couple of updates have made some really annoying changes. Have to scroll to bottom of rcvd email to see attachments, some emails will show in inbox but when try to open K9 closes down, sync doesn't seem to work properly now, will go hours without getting new messages and loads come in together, and pictures in mails don't always show properly. Please give me older version back, I used to love it!!!",114,_
Really well designed app. Love it. I never give 5 stars,114,_
K9 email is efficient and secure I love the pgp support. Makes it easy for a privacy freak like me to love and a novice to use. I have never seen better programming on any os.,114,_
Love it! My favorite email app!,114,_
"4 years of happy mobile mail :) This is an outstanding email app! It works perfectly, super customizable! Also has a very unique  and comfortable interface. It's that simple to describe it, nothing else to say, really, because it's  just great! Last year, when I bought a new phone, i didn't even try its own mail client app because i got used to k9 a lot. Thanks for your great app and amazing support!",114,_

"Keeps stopping Used to be great, but now crashes (stops) several times each day on my new phone. Getting ready to uninstall if not resolved soon.",114,_
My go-to email app.. Extremely useful. Would love to see a desktop version!,114,_
Great app Almost 3 years I using it. Love it..,114,_
"Great email client Far better than the standard android email client. Slick, responsive, functional and stable. Used it on and off for years!  I do keep trying the new standard versions when I get a new device, but always end up installing k9!",114,_
Used to be good I used to live the app but now I get emails sporadically even though my phone is set to push. Finding another more reliable email app.,114,_
Was great... Until I stopped receiving notifications so had to uninstall and use a different app. Was working fine on LG Flex but now on Huawei Mate7. Love the options though.,114,_
"Best Free eMail App I've been using K-9 for a couple of years now and it is simply a must have. It can be challenging to set up but once you do, it works great. As a UX engineer, I notice a few pain points but I'm happy to use it. I recently migrated to a new phone and tried the export/import process. Happy to say it was a success! Thanks K-9 team...",114,_
Amazing! I've used K-9 for almost nine months and I love it! Super powerful and is rock solid. F/LOSS FTW!,114,_
"The bees knees. All the other clients may have plenty of bling, but none is as powerful. Would love some updates of the UI, but once you get used to it, it doesn't even matter any more and there's no going back.",114,_
"Used to love it, but too slow I've used k9 for several years, and generally really liked it. Over the past couple of years, though, it has simply gotten too slow to be functional. Opening a message takes several seconds, as does returning to the message list. I didn't know if it was my phone ( note 2), my server, or k9. I just downloaded aqua, and though I haven't used it enough to know if I actually like it, it seems to do the trick and opens messages quickly.",114,_
"I've used this app for years to view my email via my tablet and smartphone. I've had few problems with it and it performs solidly. The only issue I've had is with sending email using ssl. Sometimes, the email won't sync because the certificate is ""invalid"" as it states. Simply resending the email usually resolves the issue. However, the message is not apparent as it doesn't pop up in the app. You have to watch for it in your notifications.",114,_
Delete The app is great and I use it for work constantly the one complaint I do have is that the delete button needs to be moved from the center of the bottom row. It is entirely too easy to delete important email. Thinking you're closing the app. Even with the option to validate it occurs. This would certainly be a 5 star review if that change was made.,114,_
I love this app! A few minute tweaks and ite would be perfect.,114,_
Doctor Who Love Doctor Who!!! The app is also great,114,_

Love it Been using it about a year now. Simple and easy. Love it.,114,_
"Great application But there's something I'd love:  Either give me an option to stop seeing notifications if I'm connected to a certain wifi network, or stop notifications on certain times. If I'm at home, I see my mails anyways, so hearing the notification sounds all the time is bothering and a bit pointless. I would love to disable them when I'm connected to my home wifi.",114,_
"I love this app I finally found a simple email app for my Android tablet. I don't need anything fancy. I just want to read my email, reply and delete them without a big production. This one allows me enough customizations but is still simple and straight forward.",114,_

Great I can't believe I have not reviewed this! I have used it on my GNEX for a couple of years and it was great! I'm having a minor problem with notifications on my S5 but it could be me.,114,_
"Good, but... Can't  delete from within an email. Annoying.",114,_

"""Allow another identity to be marked as the Sender of emails from an identityI have searched for existing issues, some relate to identities (e.g. #1117 or #935), but they are not addressing my problem/need.I would like to be able to use K9 the way I use Outlook user agent on my PC (and then be able to finally get rid off it!): in the from field, write any email address I want and have the mail sent with this address as """"From:"""".When I use a K9 identity, the smtp server of my mail host (one.com) rejects the mail (error 554 5.7.1), but again, it works when I use Outlook. Why?I had a look in the headers of a successfully sent message (from Outlook UA): the From is what I typed, but the Sender is my regular email account with which I authenticate on the SMTP server. I am pretty fine with this. I would suspect K9 maybe puts my 'From' address in the 'Sender' header as well, which would cause the error, or maybe does not set it at all (I tried to see the headers of a rejected email (from K9), I haven't seen the Sender tag, but it had not been sent, so...), which would be treated the same way.I have also spotted something strange: in the rejected email's headers, the message-ID was built with the domain of the From address, not the one of my actual SMTP account ('Sender'), maybe is it also a possible cause.Why all this? I own my domains, and I have set up specific sub-domains for emails. I can put anything before the '@', and I will get emails sent to it (kind of catch-all, but with rules behind). That way, I don't have to actually 'create' aliases (cumbersome), I can provide an arbitrary one any time, and it will work (most of the time, name/company/website@...). I can therefore spot when one of these addresses is misused and create a rule to trash all mails received through it if needed.However, this solution does not allow me to 'send' mails, except with the Outlook UA. I haven't found an Android UA capable of this (and I have tested a lot of them). I would just love if K9 was able to do it, either by default, or as an extra option in the identity settings.Please confirm how K9 handles the identities: as long as there is no SMTP settings per identity (I am personally not interested in this feature), it would seem logical to me that the Sender header (and message-ID) derive from the SMTP account being used to authenticate, not from the From header coming from the identity From email address, wouldn't it?K-9 Mail version: 5.203Android version: 6.0.1Account type  IMAP""",119,enhancement+

"For years, this was the best Android mail app available. It's unbelievable how the current developers have ruined such a fantastic email utility. Many of the old behaviors have been modified to work in unintuitive ways, demonstrating a lack of basic user ergonomics. The Unified Inbox in particular is a catastrophe. Now, unread messages show before read messages regardless of date or time. Read messages do not show at all (they completely disappear from Unified Inbox) UNLESS YOU READ THEM WITH ANOTHER CLIENT (such as your desktop PC). If you read a message with another client, it will appear below the list of unread messages, completely out of time/date order. The Unified Inbox worked perfectly in older versions, but whoever has been modifying the code for this section of K-9 is essentially incompetent.   There should be settings to configure the Unified Inbox behavior back to the old method if a user prefers that. It is after all the reason most of us switched to K9 in the first place. But the current behavior of showing messages read on another client in one way, and messages read in K-9 in another way, is just extremely poor development, and it needs to be fixed.",137,_

"Clean and quick. But bug-ridden. To test K-9 I added only my Exchange (WebDav) account. Connection was flawless, and data was read fast. I went to the Unified Inbox and there was my Exchange email. I started to explore, and went into the inbox for the Exchange account. At this point, the messages were downloaded again. Returning to the Unified Inbox, all of the messages were duplicated--two of each. I checked the folder list under the Exchange account and there are two inboxes listed. Why? I uninstalled and reinstalled... messages get duplicated in the same folder. It's ridiculous. Then I added another account, used the ""move up"" option to rearrange the accounts in the list, and it *duplicated* the account!",137,_
"Recent update is fantastic! K-9 updated itself a couple months or so ago, and it was clearly quite the overhaul because they made a pretty good e-mail app fantastic. With the new changes I get a nice UI, a dark theme, and crazy good performance. Prior to the update I had to wait for five seconds every time I hit 'back' from reading an email message, because it would take that long to reload the headers. Now all that wait is gone. I also have multiple (like, four) email accounts and they merge in a fast Unified Inbox with color coding.",137,_

Thanks for a very good and useful app.  The devs had added a gmail like letter avatars, which is nice, but the above feature is still desired.",137,_
"Best email app on Android. First off it's opensource which is always a plus in my book.  Second, unlike the native Android app which often loses its place when trying to load older messages.  Third, it has a simple message by message view that doesn't spontaneously refuse to display messages from people in threaded view based on conversations you are having with someone as has happened to me several times on the gmail app.  Finally, the unified mailbox lets me get all updates from all my email accounts as if it were a single account.",137,_

Worked fine up until last update. Now keeps crashing every time I try to compose an email (usually in the middle of it) without saving the draft. Really annoying.,142,_
"I generally prefer open source software, but crashing regularly on a Nexus 5x is forcing me to move on after many years.",142,_
"Used this app for years. It was good then became very slow and useless. After the current update, it works again. Fast now!",142,_
"Update (June 2017) stopped synchronizing.  Lowered my rating, but not yet uninstalling. /// Update  (Dec 2015).  Still by far the best email client.  /// (2013) I have used K9 for several years for my non-gmail account.  The current official version is 4.409, and it is excellent.  However, today I installed the latest version posted at the K9 Mail developer's site, 4.512, and additional improvements make this email client stand out by some distance.  Even in comparison with Gmail.  Wow!",142,_
Great email app. Normal traditional interface. A little on the slow side but stable and competent. Best I've found.,142,_
Used to be the best and only. Now it's slow at opening emails and unforgivably so. Otherwise it's a delightfully simple app with some nice options available.,142,_
"July 2017 update: Still crashing frrquently. I have sent dozens of crash reports. Most often crashes when reading email and rotating my phone from portrait to landscape. With certain emails, problem is repeatable every time.      Wish you could move an email between email accounts. Long-time user but frequent crashing has caused me to switch email apps. :(",142,_
"I've been using k9 for years and have loved it,  but the last 3 or so updates have been horrible. Slowed the app down, and caused often crashes.  I'm going to find an old version until this is resolved.",142,_
Why has this app suddenly stopped working? I have used this app for at least 2 years with NO problems. Now all of a sudden it won't fetch my pop server email! What is going on?,142,_
"Most regretful update!  I have used this app for many years.  So far so good until the recent two updates that failed the authentication check.  Worse-still, after retrying, it ended up having one of my email accounts blocked as if it's hijacked.  This happened on all my devices so I believe it's not device- or os- specific, and I believe mine is not an isolated case.  I am going to uninstall this irresponsible app for good.",142,_
The latest update on december 30th 2016 is giving a problem Attachments used to show on top of emails in earlier versions have now gone down at bottom of the thread. I am a k-9 user on android for about 5 years. Had issue with it for the first time. Kindly fix or give some option to roll back to earlier version. Thanks.,142,_
"Crashing after last update Was working well until yesterday's update. Now it's just closing without any messages, when opening email. Not on all but on most emails! Pls return previous version!!!",142,_
"Good until used 1.2 gb of data in a day! I'd been using this for years, then 1 day it used 1.2gb of data! No idea why, no email attachment could ever be this big.  Took me over my monthly data allowance. Very frustrating.",142,_
"Crashes daily I used this for years, but since it started crashing every day, I'll have to start looking for something better.",142,_
"Light weight, functional and stable The Android default email app is v boring n dull. I use K-9 for my two Outlook, one Yahoo and one own domain accounts. My two Gmail accounts are handled by default Gmail app. Though I thought it was slow in push notifications, but that seems to be working ok now. Everything I want from an email app works flawlessly in K-9. It's lightweight and superior in overall performance. Thumbs up!",142,_
"Updating and Crashing Since the update all I can do is upgrade folders, then it crashes. I hope a fix is coming soon.",142,_
Easy to use Nice clean interface. Simple to use.,142,_
"Used to work well But it's been crashing and hanging constantly, and it takes FOREVER to get thru my email. Needs serious fixes!",142,_
"Great app. Have used it for some time.  Unfortunately, started crashing every minute. So frustrating. Had to finally uninstall. Can't give higher rating until latest updates get fixed.",142,_
Has nice interface and functions but keeps on overheating my phone and crashing,142,_
Galaxy S5 Nice mail program. Using it for more then 4 years already.,142,_
Since the last update it's really slow and hangs up a lot.,142,_

"Keeps crashing, Please fix,  otherwise fine.",142,_
"Best E-mail App Stable, lots of useful features, nice UI.. great app!",142,_
Nearly perfect Does what I want it to do but with the recent update it keeps crashing.,142,_
Still crashing When download many messages the app crashing every time,142,_
"Keeps crashing since last update What changed???  Ive been using for years and have liked, but K9 keeps crashing and is unusable for the past several days.  I'm using a Nexus 5 with 6.0.1",142,_
"Best Email app Been using it for a few years, always stable.",142,_
"Use this app Though I have used K-9 Mail for over a year, I'd not posted a review.  I'm still using it so what ielse need be said?  Well, there is more.  I was prompted to post today because they just put out an update for an issue caused by an Android component update.  While it took weeks for this response, it now works again for me and in a world where sometimes these updates seem to never come, weeks is pretty good.",142,_
Very slow Since the last update it is very slow to open messages and even slower when I try to delete them.,142,_
Latest update sucks I keep getting certificate errors.  Havent been able to access my email using k9 since their last update.  Been weeks.  Uninstalling.  Id rather pay for an app I can actually use.,142,_
Nice app Nice app. But need UI to be updated for Android's 5.,142,_
Use it daily! Use this every day for work. Works great every time.,142,_
Crash Crashing on nougat. Can't use it,142,_
"Was fantastic, current version needs help... I've been using this mail client for years, and it was phenomenal.  However about 2 or 3 updates ago, it started crashing when opening certain messages or only displaying a tiny piece of the message, with the rest of the screen just a blank white space.  More recent updates have changed and tweaked this problem, but they haven't managed to kill it yet, making the app very hard to use for productivity purposes.  Back to webmail for me, and will give 5 stars once the app is stable again!!",142,_
"Great Yesterday the app started crashing on both my phones. I cleared the apps data and cache, but adding my imap account caused the app to crash again. I think k9 has a problem reading a few thousand mails? Maybe you can check this?",142,_
Update right now Yep. Fixed crashing after updating to 5.2 or something. Back to normal,142,_
Rubbish - keeps crashing No support Ask you not to rate the app bur send a mail and you get NO support App keeps crashing and has made whole phone un useable Have taken app off and cannot re install,142,_
Ver 5.001 I'm having same proplem sending after installing update to 5.001.  Latest version will not allow me to send.  Sounds like that is not the only proplem with the new release.  It has already taken too long for a fix or going back to an earlier version with less problems.  I need to find a new app.,142,_
"Bad update I have been using this app for years, never had a problem until last update.  I have been fighting this app for data usage.  And every week it keeps going higher and higher over past few months.",142,_
"Became allows after update 5.0.0.1 After the latest update my K9 became slow on opening the app, opening messages and changing folders.  Now the screen usually blanks and turns black for a few seconds before the app or message opens. Note 3.  Please address this, other than this 5 stars, especially if you added EAS.",142,_
Great Till Update I have used k-9 for years until the latest update. Now I get crashes when it trys to retrieve mail. Im exploring alternatives.,142,_
Last update killed it Was great before latest update. Now constantly crashes checking IMAP box with over 125 msgs.  Will start looking for a new app.,142,_
"Only works 50% of the time, the rest is certificate errors! Been using this app for years now, but it's been a mess ever since the lollipop update, and it doesn't look to be improving! Might have to switch to another app :(",142,_
"Coming back to an old friend ... went over to Gmail for a while, like the newer UI. But it throws huge amounts of data on my limited dinosaur and even with that, is slow. Finally, too many problems with Play services so back to K-9. K-9's two stage downloading is most effective, quick, efficient.  UI could use a good update, but as-is, very usable and friendly.",142,_
Nice app & easy use,142,_
Love it I use this on all my phones and tablets. It has been crashing quite a lot lately but it's usually only once a week and works fine after that.,142,_
Stable mail app update solved the attachment issues. one main advantage is that on kitkat it is persistent in the background which gives my mail updates even though it's killed via a app manger.,142,_
"Keeps crashing It's nice enough to use, but it crashes ALL THE TIME. Mainly after deleting messages, but at other times too.",142,_
Back to great again! Update: Problem resolved by latest update and everything works perfectly again now. Thank you!,142,_
Latest update Was great before latest update. I get error with certificate.,142,_
Version 5.0 broke the app Do not use automatic update for this app. The latest version 5.0 is incompatible with most email providers and K9s response is to get you provider to upgrade their system. NOT customer friendly!,142,_
"Going crazy here New update is not sending my messages. Wow, this is really bad!",142,_
"Latest upgrade broke it Keeps crashing, cannot use. Please fix!",142,_
"Cool app. Update: Devs: the Jan2014 update: the app crashes, is very unstable. Will update rating after the bugs are fixed. SG2 CM @ 4.3.1.  God bless you guys. Thanks for this great app. Working fine on the galaxy tab 1, A500, Note3 & GS2.",142,_
Latest Update This  was a perfect app for over 2 years.  The latest update no longer syncs with my IMAP.  Please fix and it will be perfect again.  If not I will have to uninstall and find something else,142,_
"Can't email developer The developer's email address is invalid.  Google does not recognize it.  The app keeps crashing. I also have  6 email accounts set up through K-9, but the app only sends me notifications for one of them. They all have the same settings.",142,_
Nice app Nice app..... but muliple mail configuration should be added.,142,_
"Broken since update!! Can't use it anymore, it keeps crashing!!!",142,_
"Has quit working with last update I use this app along with fire alert 2 in order to use my phone like a fire pager. The last update has ruined this app. It has worked great for months but not anymore............. After pulling my hair out, I think I have discovered the latest update requires the user to go into the settings and reconfigure different options and it seems to be working again. I guess now I can just say that a more detailed explanation on this would of helped.",142,_
Top mail app Nice and stable since last updates! Great simple easy mail app. Thanks,142,_
"Great start A great start, just needs S/MIME support and it will be perfect.",142,_
"Has potential, however unstable Frequently stops receiving mail. Pain in the butt. I use it but wish it were more reliable.",142,_
"Crashes Worked wonderfully for a long time, then I did an update and it started crashing. Uninstalled it thinking it might need a wipe (cache/dalvik/folder delete) but now it won't even run after install. Crashes on start. Shameful.",142,_
Update issues K9 mail intermittently crashes when replying after latest update,142,_
Doesn't work at all Keeps crashing ever since I installed it. Horible. I'm sorry I ever gave it a chance,142,_
I was using the app but suddenly it started crashing I reported it and to my surprise it consumed my 1.7GB data....,142,_
Time to update the UI. So many mail apps have a clean sharp and pure  interface...much like iOS...it would be nice to see that here...,142,_
"Now, slower than ever. 3/6/2014. well, if I was originally unhappy with the new ui at (4.4), I bit the bullet and went with it anyway.  Not sure of my version, but my k9 auto updates, and for about 2 months, now dog slow (apology to dog lovers) with no setting changes on my part.   Now looking for alternatives. Great, to good, to below avg, to poor over 5 years.",142,_
Was good while it worked After about a month of perfect operation k9 started crashing every time it tried to sync with the mail server. It appears to be a known issue but I couldn't see a resolution available. This stops it scoring 5 stars,142,_
Nice interface and quick but crashes I couldn't move my e-mail from my inbox to a different folder with out crashing and often wouldn't show pictures. Delete. HTC one M7,142,_
Crashy lately Latest version is suddenly failing to send and receive reliably.   Also crashing trying to open large emails.,142,_
"Why? Why does it refresh perfectly to fetch mail one day, then for the next week it spins forever then finally works perfectly again for one day? Why?",142,_
"Really slow after Kit Kat Update After my LG Pro upgraded to Kit Kat, K9 has become really slow.",142,_
Keeps crashing I loved this app for my email but I think I'm gonna have to uninstall it because it keeps crashing on my nexus 10. Should I wait for an update?,142,_
I was using the app but suddenly it started crashing I reported it and to my surprise it consumed my 1.7GB data....,142,_
"Great until last update I have been using K9 for  about 2 years and really liked it. After the last update,  I am going to uninstall. The colors are obnoxious and I can no longer mark emails for deletion from the list.",142,_
New version extremely slow. What have they done to K-9?  It is very slow and they have changed the menus completely for no apparent reason.  I may be looking for a new e-mail app.  Update: I reinstalled K9 and it is working better.  But why make us learn a new menu?,142,_
Nice app Works well for me. Very tweakable,142,_
"K9 on galaxy nexus 4.2.2 slow after update - fixed. I'm running 4.2.2 on a verizon galaxy nexus phone and after the last K9 update K9 was dog slow reading emails... like 20s reaction time.  The advice about RECREATE DATA worked for me like a charm.  K9 is great once again!  From the list of your email messages press the back/up (180 degree turn symbol) and the next menu up should have your account name. That's the one to press to get the menu with RECREATE DATA.  As is warned, the local copy of your mail will be gone and hopefully redownloaded.  Worked for me at least.  And K9 response is now quicker then before the update.",142,_
"Update sucks - Appearance and Categories I have used this app for years and updated it last night.  The Gmail categories (which were not selected on my gmail) were added to K9, which sucks!  So, lucky for me, I use Titanium Backup and just restored the previous apk and data.  I'm sure K9 will put out another update soon with the fixes for the things we don't like.    Other than that, love the app.  :o)  For now, 3 stars.",142,_
"Update introduces problems Running fine before latest update, now crashing frequently. App hangs up regularly and crashed my OS (first time ANY app has done that to my s3) Not happy!",142,_
"Ok, but . . . When it works it's OK but it's very unstable.   Especially when refreshing with new email it often just hangs or outright crashes with ""IOException:readStringUntil()..."".  Restarting the app usually fixes it but this seems to occur at least 1/day.  Samsung S3.",142,_
"Slow The previous version loaded the list of emails slow. The latest version does everything slow. Loading email,  selecting email,  deleting email,  etc.  Everything. Takes at least 2-3 seconds for the application to react to touching the screen. Recreating the account doesn't help. How do I roll back to the previous version?",142,_
"UNINSTALLING see UPDATE... Awesome 5 stars PLUS! I seldom give superb ratings, but this developer has now created an AWESONE, must-have app.  UPDATE : After update 4.409, SERIOUS LAG, FORCE CLOSES. NO HELP FROM DEV. UNINSTALLING CAN'T USE. UPDATE #2, TRIED INSTALLING AGAIN AND I'M UN-INSTALLING AGAIN. TOTALLY USELESS, LOCKS CONSTANTLY, CANNOT EVEN ACCESS MAIL NOW. I OFFERED DEBUGGER HELP TO DEV, BUT WAS TOLD THEY DON'T HAVE TIME. TOO BAD.",142,_
Full featured and reliable. K9 does everything I want. The advanced configuration options make it very flexible but are tricky if you are not mail savvy. My only niggle is that it is sometimes really slow to update the screen.,142,_
"""Use voice dictation to compose emailsIt would be very helpful in certain cases if you could compose emails using your voice (i.e: while driving, typing on a keyboard or using a pencil)""",143,enhancement+

Of very little use! Sent items from phone does not sync with Outlook....no autosuggestions while typing names in compose mail... Of very little use as you can't reply to trail mail....please give better suggestions for these problems,143,_
Great app Helpful in opening mail,143,_
I have been using it for 6 months and it's amazing. I use this to handle all my work emails and it does the job WELL! Almost the same as being in front a computer when mobile,143,_
Feature Request  : No way to see email content source ?I noticed that when someone sending me email there is no way to look at the HTML source so I can review the URLs etc to see where they are going to pull images from etc. This makes is harder to determine if you are getting phished or if the images are really trackers.It would be good if we could view the raw / mime decoded email to review its contents like I can with the Alpine email (press H) client.thanksMatt,144,enhancement+
After the last update: REALLYYYY? NO SELF SIGNED CERTIFICATES? NO EXCEPTIONS? NO PERMANENT ADDITION OF MY (free) CERTIFICATES? Can't say anything good about this so I will not say anything.  My previous review: AWESOME EMAIL CLIENT!!!! Keep up the good work and please put in the next updates a link or something where people can donate or somehow appreciate your awesome work!!!,144,_
"K-9 Mail used to be really good, but it has gone downhill of late... Among other things, it suddenly stopped working with my (IMAP) e-mail servers (despite the fact that they work everywhere else!) and the only response from the developers (via github) is ""we are working on improving the error messages"". Unfortunately, I can't wait around for the developers to fix whatever it is they broke - particularly seeing as the comments on github suggest this might not be addressed for a while... If you want something Open Source and K-9 Mail works for you, stick with it as it's the best Open Source offering out there; if you don't care about Open Source or K-9 Mail is not working for you too, well there's plenty of proprietary alternatives out there.",144,_
"Open source and supports encryption.  UI is not as fancy as some other email apps, but I can definitely live with it considering the security benefits you get with this one.",144,_
First rate much better than the packaged android email client. Does exactly what it says it does. Highly recommended  Started using k9 way way back and it's still by far the best email client for android....and now using it on my Chromebook which is now using android apps 😀,144,_
"Does everything I expect from a fully-featured email client. Even more importantly, it's free and open-source software!",144,_
"This is a very easy to use app. I have had no problems using it and haven't noticed any glitches or bugs.  It's a great alternative to Google's email client that comes with Android, for those of you who are concerned about  privacy online. I love the fact that it's open source but I don't know if the code has been thoroughly audited. Having said that I still highly recommend over a proprietary email client.",144,_
Very good mail client.,144,_
K9 is simply the most customizable and powerful email app for Android plus it is open source!,144,_
"Good app and big + for it being open source, but the lack of multi message select puts me personally off :(",144,_
"This email client offers some nice advanced configuration options and it is open source, but like so many open source projects the user interface undermines all the back end magic. The UI is so terrible here that I find the entire app unusable. Uninstalling and now in search of something that was made for use by people other than the developers.",144,_
"Definitely a must for people who maintains more than two email addresses. One good thing is that when set up properly, it downloads the contents of your email locally - including the attachments.",144,_
"As of 10/2/2014 this app is unusable.  All I get are cert errors.  No way to get it to stop.  My hosting providers cert does not match my domain name, but most email apps allow you to ignore this.  Not sure if this is related to the error I'm getting but it went from working to DoA after installing the new version.  Had to uninstall it and look for an alternative.",144,_
"On the road to perfection First off, it's open source and you can build your own app from source files hosted on GitHub. Secondly, its a 'proper' email client with non of the useless bells and whistles you see on other email clients (looking at you Gmail). Lastly, as of version 5.2, it now supports PGP/MIME (need the OpenKeyChain).  Gets better with each update.",144,_
Quite nice indeed. Highly functional. Good performance. Good features. Open source. Ad-free. 5-8 POP3 and IMAP accounts managed simultaneously in K9 for a few years.,144,_
"Versatile, robust Mailer Reliable, easy with extensive functionality. Currently the back bone of my email traffic. To me the standard open source Mailer on Android.",144,_
"Free, open but painful to look at Feature rich and works really well. I love that it's open source. The user interface is very dated, though. Text and buttons are crammed on my display. Colors are less than appealing. Terrible UX makes this difficult to use.",144,_

Good boy Fetches mail really good doesnt need much attention and does cool tricks like encryption.,144,_

"Good for getting email but not sending I don't have much problem with this app as far as checking my mail. It does a good job receiving them. But what really bothers me is every time I try to send mail it gives me the error ""some messages not sent"". Really annoying. I have to use the android email to send a message. Android email doesn't work good for receiving mail, that is why I got K9, but I have to use it to send mail.",144,_

"""Message Send Failed """"Signing requested, but no key selected!""""On the current git HEAD, on a device without any PGP apps installed, composing and then sending a message fails with a toast saying """"Signing requested, but no key selected!"""".  The effect of this is that e-mails can't ever be sent.Looking at the code this seems to be due to [line 51 of RecipientPresenter.java](.  which checks `isMissingSignKey()` which is true when `signingKeyId` is `null` in the current `cryptoStatus`.  If no PGP app is installed that value will always be `null`.I think the proper solution would be to have `isMissingSignKey()` also check if `cryptoStatus.cryptoMode` is `CryptoMode.DISABLE` and also set the `currentCryptoMode`, which currently defaults to `CryptoMode.OPPORTUNISTIC`, to default to `CryptoMode.DISABLE` as users without OpenPGP can't even open the menu to change modes.The following commit shows what I propose: .

"""key-aware recipient chooserFor sending of encrypted mail, the recipient picker should be crypto-aware. There are a couple of things to consider, and some design choices to make. Let's-a go:So first off, the material way to go is [chips](.  There are a couple of libraries for that, in OpenKeychain we use [TokenAutoComplete](.  which is mature and flexible but not quite material-design. There are also libraries based on Google's internal chips library from the GMail app, like [android-chips](.  but those aren't really made to be anything else but regular contact pickers and I havn't found one which looked mature. Since material design in k-9 isn't really there yet anyways, I would go with the more established and maintained option here, i.e. TokenAutoComplete.So, what do we actually want to show in the list? At the moment, a list of e-mail addresses (not contacts) is shown, queried from `ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Email`. This is the obvious thing to show, and it seems more reasonable than a list of contacts so I would just keep it that way. What I would like to add is an annotation to each address about its crypto-status.In OpenKeychain, we have icons to show the key status - a green checkmark, yellow question mark, and some red ones for revoked/expired/unsuitable for operation. The problem is, outside of an explicit crypto context, it's not clear that these icons are about the status of some encryption key, so we really can't use them here. We also don't need info about special states of a key - revoked or expired keys are simply irrelevant for recipient selection.My proposal would be to use Threema's concept: Three dots, with three states """"one in red"""" / """"two in yellow"""" / """"three in green"""", all others greyed out. Check out ma [mock-up](.  The idea is to be mildly alarming (""""just one of three""""), but also suggest a way to progress (""""key available, two out of three"""", """"verified that thing, three out of three!"""").A different approach would be a lock in different states (red/yellow/green with open / closed+questionmark / closed+checkmark), but I'm a) missing the progress aspect of the three-dots concept, and b) an open red lock next to each mail address is just a tad too alarming - if the UI tells the user """"this is unsafe!"""", they might just migrate to a different program which is equally unsafe but does nothing to inform the user about that fact.Some more thoughts:- if a valid (or even confirmed) key is available, the user will likely want to encrypt - optimize for that.- encryption without signing is not a reasonable use case and I would not support it.- pgp/mime vs pgp/inline is an orthogonal problem to everything mentioned here, I would leave it for later- do we need a contact-picker-button? the gmail app removed theirs recently. If we do, the information it displays should be identical to the dropdown.""",153,enhancement+

I also like that it displays my contact pictures in the message list - I was wishing my old email could do that.  I don't really know what the hubbub is about the letters beside the messages - it does not add much value, but does not deserve the vitriol i have read on so many other reviews.",164,_

"""New Feature request: command line to execute before stablishing connections towards the e-mail serverHello,For me it would be very useful the application to have the possibility to store, for every account, an optional field (command line to execute before stablishing the connection towards the email server).This field would contain a command line which would be executed before trying to connect to the email server.In my case, this would be useful, because I am planning to use fwknop in the linux server where I will have the email server.The fwknop functionality gives you the possibility to close all ports of your server until the server receives an appropiate combination of tcp messages. In such a case, the fwknop server would create firewall rules to open the port requested for a few seconds.In these few seconds, the client can connect to the server because the ports are open.fwknop2 is an application available in Android as open source code.I suppose this fwknop2 application could be modified to have the possibility of being invoked to send the fwknop messages from the command line, and then, using the new feature just requested for k-9, open the ports before attemting to connect to the email server.```---------```1.2.3.K-9 Mail version:           For new versionsAndroid version:            For all versionsAccount type            For all account typesP.D.I suppose you are very busy with other implementations.In this case, I could offer my services to try to program this request.Although I am not very familiar with Android, I have quite experience programming with Java and I think I could succeed with this development.Please, let me know what do you think about it.Kind regards,Fran.

Star Brilliant mail app that ahead of its time lord. A small issue with the favourites starin the message list. It is placed over the message list slide so when you try to select the star the app moves the message list down the page. Forcing me to go into each message to add the star. Would be great if you could move the star over to the left side under the multi select boxes so they can be used in the same manner to avoid this frustration. Each a bit bigger would also be great for easier selection problems.,177,_

"5.0RC1 almost certainly not ready for prime time. I love this app and it's great for what I use it for -- multiple secure IMAP connections, including one to a fussy MSExchange service. But the latest version here stores HUGE numbers of ""Exception: message count -1 for folder XXX"" and I/O errors and PUSH errors in the K9 Errors folders -- and these aren't errors. They're what happen when you walk around with a mobile device and change wifi speeds, access points, and cell towers. And those exceptions now take up space in your message storage for the app. Also they've discontinued the option for older security methods -- and that's great for security, except when you have to turn security OFF because you can't personally upgrade the server you have to use. I may have to downgrade to maintain usability for my needs, but in all I'm very happy with this app and the hard work from the development team to keep this a five-star product.",177,_

"Great tool! Though Sent Items folder cannot be synced easily. I am trying using K-9 mainly for offline search and it seems to work just fine. However my sent email at Office 365 is in folder called Sent Items (likely this is always the case with Outlook and cannot be changed) and, despite I specifically configured K-9 to sync Sent Items, it still insists on syncing Sent (and finds nothing). I hope this issue can be patched.  Thanks a lot for the great tool!  Update: Go to 'Account settings > Fetching mail > Incoming server' and press the ""Next"" button. This will refresh setting and cause K-9 to sync Sent Items.",183,_

seems to do the job I switched to this because I moved all my mail back to IMAP and the default mail app was not saving my sent emails. Now I have all my received and sent synced up.

Secure  and open source. Secure. Security is priority in my book and for now this App meets the requirements. Other high rated Apps like Aqua mail have analytics in their App. Blue Mail another high rated App  has loop hole where your mail passes and can be held on their mail server. K9 mail is open source which means it can be inspected for security risk. Reviews on Internet show it to be safe and secure across the board. Not the best of interfaces but worthy trade off for me.

I've given up on this flawed app.",199,_

"Looked good but ... I was looking for an email app for my moto x to replace the stock app which would not delete multi-emails.  I run Outlook on my desktop PC.  I installed K9 on my moto x yesterday and it was easy to set up.  Today I noticed that the emails on my PC did not match the emails on my moto x... some were missing from both; in other words if I have K9 running, the incoming emails go to K9 but are not duplicated on my PC email. Not good. I need ALL incoming emails on BOTH my phone AND PC. I looked though all of the settings - no help. I went online and tried for two hours to get help from K9... I am technically savvy, but getting help from K9 is impossible.  So unfortunately I uninstalled K9 and reinstalled the stock app that I don't like, but it works as it should. Thus the one star.  If I could have accessed some help without wasting my entire morning I would keep that app and give a higher rating. K9, if you're reading this please contact me and help me!",199,_

K-9 Mail is having trouble when OpenVPN connect is activated.  All other apps and web sites work fine.  Even when the VPN is then disconnected on LTE the problem persists.  Moving next back to WiFi the problem still persists as well.  Only a reboot of the phone seems to help.,216,_
Almost perfect Does a great job but when working with GPG it sometimes fails to open the encrypted mail and only displays an unusable file. Sometimes it stays in an endless loop of synchronisation so I have to use the settings to stop the app. Otherwhise perfect,216,_
Used for quite some time I have always been delighted with this app but recently it seems to entirely hog resources when checking mail. This is a particular difficulty in a poor service areas.

Use 'Sender' field to provide on behalf of informationA message with a **Sender** and a **From** field that are different should show in the Message View:`{Sender} on behalf of {From}`In the Message List I think just {From} is reasonable (current behaviour) - this is what Outlook does.`{From}`The only example I have of this is a meeting forwarded by someone using Outlook.

Latest update caused issues. I have been using K9 for my Yahoo email account for about 4 years.  I have a mail server at home which downloads and deletes my Yahoo emails (which is why I don't use Yahoo's app).  I have had the same exact settings on K9 since the beginning. Never had an issue.

It causes me to turn off sync, which defeats the purpose of time intervals anyway. Thanks for a great app.",243,_
Product Declining Use to love the product but the sync of folders and search for emails is getting bad.

Although not able to sync Sub-folders... has many useful features such as being able to fetch mail even if android is in stamina mode.

It is also pretty lightweight and fast. After reading some of the reviews of problems after v.5.0x, I had to go and see what I had and I do have 5.001 which works just fine for me.

Email forwarding Doesn't forward attachments from IMAP server.,280,_
issues with saving to draftsK9 doesn't save the signature in the draft.Therefore it forgets changes in the signature that were made for this particular email.And it saves quotations from previous emails to the draft even if you clicked on the x to not include them.If you reopen the draft with K9 Mail the signature will be the default one again.If you open it with another email program (IMAP) it won't display any signature at all (at least Thunderbird didn't),281,bug+
Wipe Out Last 2 upgrades have wiped out all saved and deleted emails. Other than screen printing not much of a way to save one external to the program.

Notifications raised incorrectly with multiple accountsIf you have multiple accounts for K-9 and you get new email in them you should get one notification per account. What actually happens is that new emails are listed under the wrong notification. For example if I have account A and account B. 1. I get an email from A2. A notification is created for A. This is correct. 3. I get an email from B.4. A new notification is created for B. This is also correct. 5. The notification for A is updated with the email from B turning it into a multi-line notification. This is incorrect.Seen on: K-9: master branchAndroid: Nougat (7.0)Nexus 6P,284,bug+

My opening page displays the two accounts where I can select all the Email, just Unread Email, or the IMAP folders.  Each account has a different Home key color and sound notification.  To be absolutely, sure K-9 was the best for my needs, I evaluated several IMAP Email clients for synchronization, usability, and most importantly, battery drain.

"This app is very nice, but still misses one feature, may be you can consider this for future releases. It will be very good to have the possibility to change the poll frequency depending on time, something like in samsung mail client top hours (working hours) - once in 3 min, during normal time once in half an hour (the polling time are just examples). Now it is possible to set the polling time only globally not depending on time frame. Thanks, and good job!",294,_

"HORRIBLE NEW ICON. A good email client especially if you have a number of accounts, very configurable and I've not had a problem in several years.

"Brilliant with room for improvement I've been using K9 for a long time now with no major complaints. I love being so in control with the variety of settings. Only 2 things prevent 5 stars: 1) IMAP accounts often report old unread messages as new and throw notifications. 2) Without the ability to copy settings from one account to another, setting up new accounts just how you want them can be tedious.",298,_

"A few quirks I wish would be fixed. Overall, it's a very good email client. The best I've seen on android. But really any setting beyond the most basic must be changed for each account individually. I ask for an option where you can select what settings to apply to all selected accounts. Currently, I find a setting I want to change, then end up changing it 8 more times for my other accounts. If this could be changed, it would be 5 stars. As it is, changing the settings for all the accounts individually is too much of a pain.",298,_
