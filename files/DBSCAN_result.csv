Over the last few months when I fetch messages, it downloads old messages from months ago that have all been read and some were deleted. Went online to my mail provider and selected All messages as read even though they wete showing as read to be sure. Made zero difference. Still randomly get 10 to 20 very old emails already read or deleted in my inbox. Very frustrating. Also have 2 yes 2 trash boxes in same account. I have 4 accounts all have 2 trash boxes. A deleted message is duplicated into each trash box. I have to delete both. Also when I write a message and send it creates duplicaye message. One is sent the other is duplicated again and placed in each trashbox. Seriously a pain. installed on both my Android 6.0.1 LGG4 and 6. 0.1 LGG5 and both do this. Please fix",_,10

It appears that most of the people making negative reviews have just failed to wade through the very extensive settings menus. Most of the features people are asking for, such as threaded conversations and checkboxes for multiple selections, can be enabled there. Messages can be moved to folders by long pressing them, at least on IMAP. I don't use POP3, so not sure if it is possible with those accounts. True, it does not allow changing fonts, but neither does the stock email app. Whether it overrides font settings that you make within the settings for your email account, I don't know.

"One of the nicest looking email programs if you like dark theme For 90% of my email, this works great using the dark theme.  But for one type, it just won't work (it used to, but either the app changed a while back, or the sender changed formats).  For example, I get email promotions from Fry's Electronics that has images for the special deals.  With this app, using the dark theme,  they are all totally blank.  I can click on one, and be taken to the web page via the browser, but that's a pain, and I can't even tell what it is first.  Using the light theme works fine.  I've tried both ""show pictures"" and ""download complete message"", but neither one works for these images.  I'd enter a bug report, but they make it too hard to do unless you know exactly what the cause is.  I can provide an example, but I don't know why it happens because most email looks fine.

Frequent crashes are the norm, and filling in the reports is pointless as there's no-one to reply. 3. Because it's open source, there's no customer support to ask for help.

In my experiments, the execution of those functions on the main thread may be the main cause of the eye-detectable delays (i.e., hang-bug) experienced with K9 while opening emails.Moving work off the main thread leads to higher responsiveness of the app. I suspect that it is actually possible to run the """"clean"""" and """"getAsString"""" functions on a background thread.

"""[Bug: Regression] Upgrading from K-9 Mail 5.008 to 5.010 breaks its Share functionality under AlienDalvik (AOSP 4.1.2): K-9 always crashesUpgrading from K-9 Mail 5.008 to 5.010 breaks its Share functionality when attaching a file to an email under AlienDalvik (based on AOSP 4.1.2) in Jolla's SailfishOS 2.0.1.11 K-9 always crashes, a pop up window is displayed stating, """"Unfortunately the application com.fsck.k9 has stopped. [OK]"""". By clicking on [OK], K-9 restarts, and saves the message in the Drafts folder, but without the file being attached. I checked the following: - Using the Share functionality between other applications works: I tested between Amaze, OpenKeychain, TurboEditor and a few native SailfishOS applications.  - Using the Share functionality in other Android applications in order to send a file to K-9 Mail always crashes K-9 in exactly the same way (as described above), no matter if K-9 was running or not. - Sharing data (not a file) does not crash K-9 Mail, but seems to exhibit another bug: a handle (?) is inserted into the mail body, not the data sent, e.g. with data sent from BarcodeScanner:   [Subject] Barcode Scanner - Plain text  [Body] . ?id=com.fsck.k9  I will file a separate bug report, when sufficiently tested to write up something more comprehensive.- It also makes no difference, which Android application is picked, when using the Share functionality from within K-9 Mail for attaching a file to an email: K-9 always crashes.  Tested with Amaze file manager and TurboEditor.  - Only when I pick SailfishOS' native Gallery application (which is the third application offered besides Amaze and TurboEditor when attaching a file in K-9 Mail on my Jolla Phone), K-9 does not crash and the file is indeed attached.  But it is not Android's internal Share mechanism being used here, instead the still somewhat fragile Share functionality between Android and SailfishOS applications provided by Jolla's SailfishOS 2 is utilised.  In this specific case (attaching a file to an email in K-9) it even works consistently stable, but unfortunately SailfishOS' native Gallery app allows to select picture file formats (e.g. jpg, png), only. - After downgrading from K-9 Mail 5.010 to 5.008, the Share functionality works fine, again. I am sure willing to make further tests, checks and balances, when provided with instructions how to. Please do try to fix that, as the inability to attach arbitrary files to emails in K-9 Mail renders the beautiful and feature laden K-9 useless as a generic email client. Cheers and Kudos for maintaining and enhancing the best mobile email client I am aware of.  And I am really looking forward to the progress on PGP/MIME. P.S.: I suspect the MIME handling changes introduced in K-9 Mail 5.009 to be the cause.  From K-9's changelog on .  5.010[...]5.009[...]Improved MIME type handling when other apps share files to K-9 Mail[...]""",bug+,53

Awful Everytime I try to check my mail it says that there is no connection.  It also no longer notifies me when I have new e-mail.  And when I delete my mail it will not cross over to my computer.  So frustrating.  Have Yahoo mail on my mobile for my business account and I love it. If I could install it twice I would. Deleting this ap now!,_,0

"""Incomplete sync with IMAP-InboxI have a somehow strange behaviour since a couple of weeks: The inbox of my imap-mail-account (at 1&1) is not correctly synced any more. With Thunderbird or the 1&1-Webmail, I can see all my mails, but K9 only shows a few. When I get new mails, K9 does not show most of them, only some.This seems to be limited to the inbox. Other IMAP-folders can be synced and seem to display all mails.I tried to clean up the inbox-folder (""""expunge"""" with K9 and according operations with thunderbird/webmail client), but no effect.I use the current version of K9 (v5.006) under Android 5.0 on two different Samsung devices. Is there any more information I should provide that could help?""",bug+,58
"Used K9 as my primary Android client for several years, and have been happy with it for the most part. Easy to configure, not a 'resource hog' and hardly ever encounter a problem. Doesn't seem to work perfectly with Google mail (some issues with keeping my mailbox synced across devices / messages not downloading to other clients once K9 has retrieved it, despite several times checking settings) but this is minor. For me, K9s biggest strength was as a simple to use POP3 client, which has become a little diminished now that many ISPs are no longer providing / have withdrawn email services. Despite these minor criticisms, I still prefer K9 over anything else on Android. I have to agree that the new icon is terrible - it looks like the naughty Coyote that would signal my game of 'Dragon World' on a BBC computer at school was over!",_,59
I think its the best webmail client after gmail,_,0
"Wow! I Didn't Realize I Had So Much Crap In My Inbox I really love K9. I used TypeApp for quite a while and actually would recommend it above all the other email apps, except this one.

"""High battery consumption (request: disable sync on low radio signal?)Hey there,I am a long time K9 user which is using K9 for almost 5 years now. Everything is working perfectly except one thing: Battery consumption is way too high when K9 is just running in the backround.I am running 2x gmail push accounts + 2x own-mail-server imap accounts on a Nexus 6 (previously Nexus 4 and HTC Desire HD).On my large Nexus 6 screen 2hours of """"screen on time"""" is consuming as much or sometimes less battery than K9 which would run in the backround. On my Nexus4, K9 would sometimes completely drain the battery within 1 hour.My guess is that K9 is using so much battery because of low radio signals or being not connected to HSDPA?I tried creating a tasker script which would disable android auto-sync (which also stops auto-sync + push in K9) when the radio signal is low for a certain amount of time and only reactivate it when the signal is good again for a certain amount of time.Battery consumption is still high but better than before so I am wondering if K9 could get this feature out-of-the-box?I don't know what other ways are possible to minify battery consumption but K9 is, just right now as I am writing here, still using 1% more battery than my screen would use in those 30-40mins of writing (I am connected to WiFi at home or have full HSDPA+ signal while driving in thr car).For troubleshooting:I re-installed K9 several times (also on several devices). Sizes of e-mail accounts (if relevant):Gmail push #1: 114MBGmail push #2: 6MBOwn mail server imap #1: 331kb (syncs every 10 mins)Own mail server imap #2: 3MB (syncs every 10 mins)Thanks in advance !""",enhancement+,60

"Been using K9 for some time. Use to like it. Then it quit showing new emails coming in unless I pushed(?) it. Now it won't push(?) new emails at all at any time, so I have to do it manually every time. Didn't want to give it only one star, but cannot figure out how to get this fixed. Even went into the links they ask you to try before giving it a low rating. Couldn't figure it out. May have to go to another email server.",_,62
It's a great very versatile app. The only thing I'm wondering about is it's energy consumption. It does wake the CPU quite little and also data usage is not that high compared to others. Yet it consumes quite some power. Any thoughts?,_,0
"Changing this review, as the old one was about the interface change that nearly made me quit using the app a few years ago.  Since the last update, K-9 has been draining battery like crazy.  I'm beginning to think it may have to do with the app getting stuck trying to refresh IMAP mail when there is a loss of network or network change, like changing from wireless to cellular data.   It apparently just churns away.  Side note:  I can't stand the new icon.  The older one was a bit odd and kitschy but it was comfortable and familiar.  The battery issue would get any other app a 1 or 2 star rating, but since K-9 is the only app I still use, that I used on my first android, it gets a slight pass (along with hope that it will be fixed.)",_,63
"I came looking for a secure email solution, and found a nice unexpected surprise... the ONLY email app I know of that lets you use a DARK theme.

"Very flexible in tuning but eats the battery. Samsung S8+, while all apps are battery consumption is 0.0x, this app is 1.8",_,0
K9 was one the best mail app but Android Doze in Android 7 made it unfortunately unusable. Polling and push mails both don't work anymore even if you exclude the app from Doze. Google overdose the battery saving and K9 got killed by it. :-(,_,0
"As much use as a chocolate fireguard. With a poor data connection it just sits and spins for ages, draining the battery,  then silently gives up without reporting an error.",_,0
Ever since nougat update the app disables regular/active polling. Has to do with battery management and the doze functionality within the OS. K9 is aware but going on for several months without a solution. Probably changing apps.,_,0
I have been using this email client for years without any problems. The latest update seems to be a battery killer though. I hope they fix it soon or I will need an alternative.,_,0
"Love the features and flexibility, particularly for managing several different email accounts and being able to NOT have to use conversation view.  However, the app periodically stops working. How is that possible? Runs great for weeks, then suddenly it stops syncing. Or starts throwing authentication errors. Or, randomly hangs and consumes 30% of my battery.  I clearly don't understand app development because what should be done is the developers fix the bugs and then simply stop. Don't do anything else after that. Have a great new idea? Call it K-10 Mail and let those who need changes for the sake of changes over reliability download that.",_,64
Same problem as others here: syncing does not work correctly. Pity ... but look in the GitHub bugs: a sort of solution seems to be dialing battery optimization for K9. Waiting for a better fix.,_,0
Stopped working...no push. Been brilliant for ages but now have to go to app to get mail. Become a pain in the bum. Please fix it.,_,0
"I've found the solution to the ""syncing disabled"" issue that some people have been experiencing on Android Nougat.   On Android Nougat there are 2 processes that restrict apps and put unused processes to sleep. First is ""App Power Monitor"" which is a Samsung feature that puts apps to sleep that haven't been used or accessed for a while so they don't keep running in the background consuming unnecessary battery power and memory. This is the one that most people seem to know about and have tried but without much success. This is because there is a second, albeit very similar process that is actually causing the issue.  It's something called called ""App Optimisation"" which is a built in Google Android feature designed to put certain apps to sleep or (Dose) when the phone is locked for a certain length of time so it doesnt wake the phone up for example while you're asleep.  It is this that's actually stopping K9 Mail from syncing. I have a feeling that what is happening is, the sync process is being put to sleep after the phone has been locked for a certain amount of time but upon waking up the phone, the sync is not being switched back on again.  To solve this issue, go to Settings/Device Maintenance/Battery and click on the [Battery Usage] button next to the estimated battery life %. Now on the battery usage screen click on the top right menu and select ""Optimize Battery Usage"". Here you will see a list of apps that are not being monitored. As you will see, there is a warning message at the top of this page saying that ""optimising apps that rely on sync data may be affected"" which is a big clue why your email client might not be syncing. You will also interestingly see that the built in stock email app has by default already been made exempt (not optimised) so clearly it is not meant to be switched on for email applications. So let's go ahead and turn it off for K9 Mail.  First, click on where it says ""Apps Not Optimised"" and select ""All Apps"" from the drop down menu. Scroll down until you find K9 Mail from the list of available apps and go ahead and uncheck it. Now when you go back to the pull down menu and select the option to view 'Apps Not Optimised' you will see that K9 Mail has been added to the list of exemptions and therefore background sync will not be put to sleep.  This should resolve the issue. Since I have done this my email has been working fine.",_,65
"Very good email client! FIX FOR ""SYNCING DISABLED"" :   It's caused by your phone battery management that kills the poll. Go to your settings, search for battery management, and look for k9 and define ""ignore battery optimization for this app"". This procedure may differ with other phones but the problem is caused by this.",_,0

Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems, only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month. At the risk of stating the obvious, this is insane! Having persevered with this for years, I've now given up, uninstalled and gained about 3 hours battery life per day.

"Good email app; battery drain As an e-mail app for Android, I love K-9. It's flexibility means you can do anything you want (I never hit limits), and the UI is intuitive and easy to work with.  However: I recently noticed my phone was draining its battery too fast. I did some tests, fully charging the phone, rebooting it, leaving K-9 open in the background to pick up my emails, but reading them with another app I wanted to try out. 10 hours later, K-9 had run up one hour of ""keep awake"" time (even though I hadn't opened the app once - it was all background) and the other app (that I'd used throughout the day) just 9 minutes. So I disabled K-9, but the ""keep awake"" time kept increasing one minute in ten, so some background process was obviously thrashing the CPU.  The next day, phone rebooted, K-9 disabled - the phone is cooler to touch and its charge lasted the full day. I don't know which update introduced the problem, but at some point K-9 has started using too much battery, where other apps (used in the same way) have not.  I like the app enough to return to it - after some more upgrades, especially if they mention battery issues - I'll probably give it another try.",_,71

I do like this app App is a loy better than the stock s3 app.  But has been buggy lately with getting stuck syncing mail.  It will just continue trying to sync and drain the battery down.  Wish it would time out and not kill my battery.,_,0
"very disappointed using this app many years, never had problem before. now, in the past couple days i had battery drained overnight completely. as soon as sync for k9 disable , no drain anymore. i saw many of us who use k9 got same problem, dev please fix.  nexus 5 with 4.4.2 installed.",_,0
"Battery hungry K-9 mail drains battery too fast when on data network. It usually goes around 10-20%, and today it uses 70%. There is definitely some bug, my suspicion is when handling unstable network.  But other functions works great so I give 3 stars. Keep up the good work.",_,0
"Love the app but.... As of right now.. This drains SO much battery, we are talking about 50% of the battery. I don't know if there's a setting or just issues in the code.",_,0
"""[feature request] do not set `seen` flag on downloaded mailsI recently changed my mail setup to have K9 fetch mail from Dovecot IMAP server using a Maildir mail storage which is synchronized across multiple computers. Since then, each mail downloaded by K9 becomes flagged as """"seen"""" and this changes Mutt handling of it.This issue is to request a way to configure K9 so to request NOT to flag the mail as """"such"""".Note: this is not read/unread flag but something different (mutt renders these mails as """"O"""" for """"old"""", which means they are still unread but """"shown"""" before [from+subject]).""",enhancement+,72

Great app I have been using K9 for years but have recently had some small issues. On occasion all messages show as read but the header still shows 1 unread message.  Also id like to put in a feature request for printing. I can share to my HP app but it complains of unknown file type.,_,0
"""Support SMTP ENHANCEDSTATUSCODESThe error messages we get back from SMTP are often hard for a user to interpret and analyse.Gmail (potentially other providers too) supports RFC 2034 which provides enhanced status codes (defined in RFC 1893)K-9 should detect this extension and better parse the error messages it gets as a result. This issue can just be about handling the extension codes and better managing the structured data we send back to the front-end in an exception.Making better use of that data is a separate issue (likely in concert with the Design Overhaul).In all likelyhood this probably means converting:`535-5.7.1 Username and Password not accepted.

"Doest Work with exchange Tried the app on my nexus 7 for my work exchange mails, but it failed to work. Could not find server even though the settings work fine with lots of other mail clients.  Surprised that this highly rated app struggles to do automatically find ones exchange account and set it up accordingly. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.",_,0
Powerful and simple and free Best email client I've found hands down. It has a bunch of features other don't (like identities) and has a lot of nice customization,_,0
Too bad A decent little app and seems to have a good community of supporters. But being unable to sync Exchange subfolders is a deal-breaker for me.,_,0
Doesn't accept exchange server Keeps saying the URL is not valid although it works with every other Android mail app I've tried do far...,_,0
"Exchange Support? The UI could be modernised as well. It appeals to the open source, PGP/GPG market, and that's why I still happily use the app! Just wish I could use all my accounts with it.",_,0
Best email client I've used so far I tested over 10,_,0
"At last! I use my tablet for traveling, hence I want things to be relatively simple, not to interfere with apps/programs on my main computer, and to be easy and quick while I'm on the road.   Other apps just tried to do too much and did little well.  I had resigned myself to only using web-based apps (what to do when, as I often am, out of WiFi contact)😟  Thank you for K-9!",_,0
Much better than factory mail client I love that you can store messages on the SD card as I was running out of memory on the device storage. I have Exchange sync perfectly an IMAP account and also Gmail and everything works perfectly. For people having issues with Exchange Google which URL you are supposed to use.,_,0
The Best Great app.,_,0
Simply the best email client for Android.  Leaves you in control of your email.,_,0
"Best. 2nd device so far I like K9,  it's so far the best app for multiple accounts and with no single ad! Thank you ! Thank you ! Thank you ! It take some time to figure it how it works, but when you get it, it's a piece of cake. My second device so far with it. I tried on this one some newer email aps, like BlueMail, but they have lots of ads, and pop ups for comercials, so I got the old one, old but gold K9, and I'm in piece now. K9 is maybe a litle complicated, and maybe look outdated, but it's all crap.  THIS APP RULZ!",_,0
"Use it all the time They do have the very best!  Some time ago,  K9 blew it for lollipop and I  had to give bad rating.  I then tried 5 apps highly rated but none measured up.  Over many months all is well!",_,0
The best for old school email lovers,_,0
"My favourite mail client If you make a paid version and add exchange functionality, I would buy it  in a heartbeat.",_,0

Does not work with Hotmail. Like so many other mail clients. Microsoft...,_,0
"Best for a reason Faster than any other app, much easier to use than any other. I tested almost all mail apps for Android but keep going back to K-9",_,0
"Best mail client for Android The design of the app looks somewhat old-fashioned and the configuration menu structure is more complicated than I would like it to be, but all things considered this is by far the best email client available for Android. I've tried Gmail, and liked it too, but unfortunately that app cannot send plain text messages! Can you believe it? K9 won't give you that kind of trouble. Also, I believe it's the only email client for Android that supports IMAP IDLE .",_,0
take best email app and destroy it last version is simply useless.,_,0
Simply the best If you like your email a little old school such as a Outlook than you will love this app. There's much less of Randomness than Gmail and it's easy to control every aspect of this program. Thank you for a great app,_,0
Great Best email program out there,_,0
Best of the many I've tried .......but still room for improvement,_,0

"This is the best email client. IMAP and POP3 support. No ads. In several ways, K9 Mail is superior to higher rated email apps.",_,0
"Awesome email client Better power consumption than other mail clients, and handles conversations well. Only issue is how it handles exchange accounts, but I can use it as an IMAP client for exchange.",_,0
"NOT the best email app for android. In fact not even better than stock. So many times i've tried k9 mail now and came back disappointed every time. It crashes randomly, is impossible to set up with Exchange and does not even properly support Push! The app boasts to be best android email app but in fact is not even better than the stock android mail client. Quite the contrary! In stock client you just enter MS Exchange email address and password, done. Not so in k9! Maybe one day when k9 mail does not suck I'll give it 5 stars. Until then,  1 star for repeatedly wasting my time.",_,77
k9-Mail app does not have Exchange Active Sync Support. I liked the App but no Activesync... Can't Use it,_,0
Best Android mail client I've used k-9 for over 3 years on 4 phones and it still remains very practical. No unneeded bells and whistles.,_,0
"Best mail app For  me the best mail app. Stable, perfect.",_,0
The best I've tried several and this is the only email app I will use. Even supports Exchange.,_,0

Best Email App This is one of the best Email apps on android. .I can even get microsoft exchange on it.  The only problem I am having is getting Microsoft Outlook to work on it.   Also I wish it had widgets.  Probably should have given it 5 stars.,_,0
"Best Email app! And I've tried a lot! This is a very customizable email app that does everything you want from an email app.  I didn't love it the first time I tried it, but after spending a few minutes setting it up the way I want it, I realize it's the best email app available!  Keep up the good work! It would be nice if there was a local folder where emails could be saved and not lost when it's not in the most recent 25/50/...",_,78
Cannot setup Exchange account The same configuration works for the others but not this app. I don't know why.,_,0
Look and feel is outdated now... ...but even after 4 years use it is still the best organised mail client I've seen.,_,0

Best mail client Powefull and light. Only missing part is support for Exchange 2010 😢. Hope will be sorted out very soon.,_,0
"A wonderful email app It's a great daily driver, but I find that it doesn't play well with every Exchange server. It worked great at my university's, but poorly with my employer's. I love it for my personal e-mail though. Improve Exchange support and add MIME/PGP for five stars.",_,0
"Best email client. Classic interface, customizable. Had to move from gmail and android default mail after they started their ""conversations"" nonsense.",_,0
Best one I've found A few issues. It appears to stall often on gmail and requires killing and restarting before it will finally pickup mail from the account,_,0
Perfect ! One of the best email client ! Please provide ActiveSync support.,_,0

Fantastic! Best android email app. Love it!,_,0
"The best I've tried other clients and al be it they look pretty but they all have one problem,  they lack functionality,  I have not come across another program yet where I can pull up the headers. Sure you get a senders name but that's it, where's the detail, where did this email originate from? And that's the problem with every other program I've tried.",_,0
"Best mail app By far the best mail app. Works with every email service I've tried. Rarely has issues, and is usually caused by poor handling of existing connection issues.",_,0
Best The best email app,_,0
"Now on my S4, of course!  Perfect best third party app for mail",_,0
Missing the exchange sync Served me well but now I need exchange sync as well.,_,0
"Best mail app. Better even than the factory Android app, or official apps from providers as Gmail and Hotmail.",_,0
Fantastic Faultless app. Why can't all apps be this good?,_,0
Simply the best email client for android. The developers have really put great effort into creating a useful and powerful email app with more features and options than any other I've seen.,_,0
"Superb It might not be the prettiest but it's the best, and no shopping list of permissions to grant either.",_,0
"Great email app, need more user flexibility n control One of the best email apps available, but too many unnecessary permissions.  USB storage? I'm not rooted nor carrying any OTG.  START AT STARTUP: Even Microsoft give more control.  I love it, my battery hates it.  I'll keep an eye on the change log and decide what to do.",_,0
The Best By far the best and most complete mail app I have come across. The ease of use and the ability to customize every little detail makes an unbeatable combo.,_,0
Great App I love this email app.  I've tried them all and this is the best. Wish I could print emails though. Works well with my Samsung gear unlike other apps.  I would recommend  this to anyone.,_,0
I've tried them all.. K9 email is the best and most dependable for IMAP and POP3. The only thing missing is exchange functionality. Perhaps one day someone will use K9 as a base and extend it to have exchange functionality.,_,0

"Excellent Application with Great Functionality. After a morning of searching and infuriating failures of other apps, I came to K9. I tried Google, Outlook, and all the others. I even tried some payware. None of them came anywhere close to matching the functionality and ease-of use/setup as K9. Where Microsoft and Google have failed, a group of independent developers have succeeded. Thank you guys for having brains and the ability to use them.   Now if we can just get the icon changed... Honestly it was the silly, superficial reason I didn't come here first.",_,0
Best of the bunch After having tried out all major Android e-mail clients and some minor ones I am back at K9.,_,0

tried the rest returned to the best best featured email for android... until i saw new version has removed check boxes. with maybe 10 junk emails in every mail check i dont have time to open and delete individually. put it back how it was please. until them ill be looking for another client again.,_,0
"Best email app out there! This is the best of all the email apps I have tried. It doesn't seem to have a limit to how many accounts you can use and set up all of them very easily. My only complaint if any, and I acknowledge it's a small stupid one, is the icon. It doesn't reflect what a great business tool this is.",_,0
"possibly the best mail app Well, after testing a dozen(at the very least) of the most popular  mail apps, it seems this alongside the default mail app is the best. Not because it's ""great"" (it's not) but because of lack of true competition...",_,0

"best You may want to try a lot of mail apps, but you will stay with this one.",_,0
"MOTO X user 4/3/14 I just switched from a flip phone and iPod touch to the Moto. When I setup my exchange account, the app told me that my server REQUIRES me to allow it full access and control over MY phone. Bye bye. K-9 was setup in about a minute and a half, didn't need to allow access to any of MY personal information, and the interface looks to be well thought out and user friendly. I especially like the ""split screen in landscape view"". Granted, I haven't looked around that much, but this app works perfectly for me, so I'm done looking, on to better things. I don't even care that Gmail isn't supported. Great job, guys! Update 4/15/14: Gmail is supported but I ran into some problems when I decided to change settings on my Exchange account. Basically, every change I made caused some function to fail. Display, sync, notification problems got worse and worse until finally the app was beginning to make me feel stupid, so I uninstalled and moved on to a paid app. Regular IMAP/POP email is OK, but needs more work in order to use Exchange accounts.",_,79

This app is great! I get a lot of mail and this app has been absolutely the best at helping me manage it.   There is so much flexibility with the options that it just makes me smile whenever I open it up.  This app has everything I'm looking for in a email client!   Thank you for making this available.,_,0
"The best The best email app I have tried.. I keep going back to K9. The interface could use some improvement, and rich text editing would be nice. Still it is the standard for Android email.",_,0
Works great I think this is one of the best mail app I've used for a while to manage non Gmail accounts. It's especially great if you have more than one email account to manage.,_,0
"Good E Mail client, not best for exchange This is a good e mail client for most of the EMail purpose. However, limited signature customisation and no contact sync with server makes it less useful exchange client for me. Would love to give five star when these two updates are available in future.",_,0
"Does not work with Exchange 2010 I downloaded this for my work email and while I'm sure it's a fine email app, I couldn't test it because Exchange 2010 doesn't have WebDAV which is required to run this app. They probably should tell you this in the description.",_,0

OK for POP3 but not Exchange 404 Error when configuring Exchange yet the stock app works fine. This seems common. Would have been three stars for the POP3 except the wiki links dont work so no help to be had. Seems like this app has had its day when the stock apps are better. Shame.,_,0
The BEST! I have tried many other Android email clients on my HTC phone and Nook tablet and most leave me up short....but K-9 is the best I have had in 4 years and it allows multiple accounts and it is simple to use. It just plain works!!  Try it and you'll abandon the rest.  Thanks!   (BW),_,0
"No need to search any further! Greatest Mail prgm ever! These programmers are composed of people who have the true heart of opensource.

Wow! KitKat support in 3 days Back to being the best,_,0
"This is really a great app This app should be at the top of the list of great apps for Android. The developer knows what's up, keeps it up to date and continues to support it. Email via this client works like a breeze, any type of email account can be handled by this app.",_,0
"Nice app but NO Exchange support I liked K-9 and was looking forward to using it, but couldn't. I use Gmail, yahoo and for work Exchange.  While I could successfully connect K-9 to Gmail and Yahoo, it does not connect and work with corp Exchange.  It is unfortunate the app description doesn't openly state this and in fact has a false claim about Exchange support in its description.  It would be a great app if Exchange was supported.  Does anyone know the real scoop on its exchange support?",_,0

This allows for optimisation of SMTP network traffic### Expected behaviourWe should change the behaviour of `sendMessageTo` to use pipelining to reduce round-trip-delay when we receive the PIPELINING extension.### Actual behaviourRegardless of PIPELINING extension status we always wait for each response### Developer notesThe hard part here will be implementing SMTP command handle for asynchronous responses. Likely a queue of outstanding responses will need to be maintained.There's ample opportunity for testing here - the SmtpTransportTest code allows you to provide dummy responses from an SMTP Server. There should be tests written for:* Using pipelining when it is enabled* Ensuring pipelining is not tried when it is not enabled* Ensuring that we wait for all responses to pipelined operations before considering the message sent* Ensuring that we handle failures to one or more pipelined operations properly (and still read the remaining pipeline responses)The RFC contains examples for much of these: . 1. Enable verbose logging2. Send an email to Gmail or another server that supports PIPELINING3. Analyse the traffic""",enhancement+,83

Much better battery life than using two mail apps! Switched to K-9 after thorough internet research to consolidate a corporate Exchange and Gmail account onto one app. I had been using the stock app on Droid Mini for Exchange and the Gmail app for my personal Gmail.

"Worked well, now garbage Since the last update, I've been getting certificate errors. It's not the host. Based on what I'm seeing here, other puerile are having the same problem. Unable to securely send or receive makes this app useless, sadly.",_,0
"Was great until update Excellent until last update. Now it will not receive new email, and manual loading take forever. Usually times out!",_,0
Functional but.... Tried it due to having at least 4 email accounts and want something to wrap it all in one. Just can't find a way to like it. Not sold on the layout and really hate the polling deal for notifications. I've legitimately lost emails when I should have at a certain time. Just can't do it. Probably good for others though.,_,0
Doesn't auto download anymore I've had this on all my phones and loved it. Installed it on my new Galaxy Light and it won't auto download emails. This has caused me to miss some important emails.I've tried emailing them but they don't respond.,_,0

Latest update..thumbs down Ive used this email client for years..latest update is full of issues. Lost all emails. Seldom reveives them now. Very Upsetting,_,0
stopped working after update was a great app now after the update it is useless please fix,_,0
If theres nothing wrong dont change it Have had no problems for the better part of 2 years and now ive installed the update i cant send emails. Why cant people just leave things alone??????,_,0
"thanks for breaking your app since the update yesterday, i am unable to send mail.  i've re-entered my password, i've tried every version of accepting (or not) certificates and encrypting (or not).  you have made your app pointless. EDIT.  problem seems to have resolved.  but don't beta test upgrades on users.",_,0
Broken since last update Have loved this app since I discovered it but the last app update has made it useless. Says outgoing settings are wrong so won't send nothing. I've not changed it and double checked. Please fix asap.,_,0
"Latest update causing issues Ever since the update I get daily errors about an invalid certificate. But if I go to the account screen and connect, all is fine.   The really odd thing, is that K-9 has NO option to accept any certificate. All implementations of OpenSSL allow you to accept any cert and encrypt the channel - K-9 should have this, and just ignore any potential errors. I am not worried about a MitM attack, so just quit nagging me - or if there is a real error, tell me what it is.",_,0
"Horrible I've used this app for years, until the last update. Totally messed up my email, I can no longer use this app for anything. If it ain't broke don't mess with it. Had to uninstall. Fix please.",_,0

"Works great! I've been using K-9 Mail for a couple years now and really like it. It handles my roaming (offline) well, saving replies & drafts for later, integrates w/multiple IMAP ACCTS, etc. It just works! And is very configurable (business/fun/private accts, etc).",_,0

Wow wow wow. just about beats any other android email client out there. It looks fresh and feels extremely stable! The latest up date is just mindblowing.,_,0
"Awesome I've loved this app for a long time but the new update just sealed it. It works great, makes all my emails work together perfectly.  Beautiful tiles too",_,0
"Was great until last update I've used K-9 for over a year and it's always been awesome.  Very customizable, and I love the quiet time setting which allows you to silence it during certain hours of the day.  Since the most recent update, however, there have been many problems.  The app no longer notifies me when I have new mail on my Gmail account; I have to open up the app and look.  Even worse, it's draining my battery like crazy.  Please fix or I'll have to uninstall!",_,95
"Great email client, but... love this email client and been using it for a couple of years now, but after the last update, I need to kill the app and restart it everytime I need to check for new emails. Would REALLY appreciate a fix (using a Samsung Galaxy S4 and IMAP on SmarterMail latest version)",_,0
"Was great, but I'm searching for a new email app now Over the last month it's crashed more and more. This week, it crashes when I try to move an email to another folder. Also, after I send an email and go to the next message the new message doesn't show. Just the header does. This looks like an old issue that's resurfaced. Really making it unusable. I love the app. Just wondering if deleting and reinstalling will fix it. All the other apps I've tried this week are lacking the awesomeness of this one.",_,96
No problems I've been using this app for 3 years,_,0
Great App Great app I've been using it for years.  Always reliable and works great.,_,0
"Since update my checkboxes don't work. I can select all or none, but can't choose just the ones I need. Please fix!	Great app, but much more reliable than the stock email on my Captivate. Consistently downloads my Comcast AND Yahoo mail on 3G or WiFi.",_,0
"""update"" someone's idea of improvement Seriously?  The latest update is just crap.  Never has so little been billed as so much.  Did someone actually think this was an improvement?  Not.  Update - more and more updates, and clearly ignoring the feedback of others.  It just keeps getting less user friendly with every ""update"".  Developer's reply, ""you can download the old versions""  Seriously?",_,0
"Nexus 5 issue temp fix If you have a nexus 5 with KitKat 4.4 and your messages are blank, disable auto fit in global settings.  Great free email solution overall. Don't give a 1 star just because a new version of OS broke something, and you've been using it perfectly for years. That's not fair.",_,0
"Great email program, but problems on Nexus 5 with Kit Kat I've been using this email client since the T-Mobile G1 days, and it's always been excellent.  I've tried a few others, but always revert back to K-9.   My favorite feature is the support for IMAP IDLE, providing push email support.  The only improvement I could think of that this app could use would be support for S/MIME encryption.   I've been able to use Djigzo to send and view encrypted emails, but it's a clumsy solution.  Having it integrated into K-9 would be perfect.",_,97
"Just keeps getting even better I've been using this app for three generations of android, currently running under KitKat on a nexus 7 and moto g. As a single email client managing five different email accounts, it's smooth and very effective.",_,0
not the biggest 4.x fan but still great k9 has been my favourive email app for years now as it provides just what i need: a highly configurable und compact imap email app without any bloated crap functionality. i've had so me issues after upgrading to 4.x initially but got everything smoothed out so far...,_,0
"Dreadfully slow since update It has become almost unusable on both my Nexus 7 and samsung galaxy s3. I've tried the recreate data fix,  but still same issues.",_,0
Cool email client app Great app so far using a day. I was tired of using galaxy s4 default email client which gave me hard time coz of reloading deleted messages and when refreshed the old mails popped up as unread. This app seems work great so far.,_,0
"""Email Notifications on Android WatchI love K-9 mail and love my new LG Urbane. I correctly get notifications for new email on the watch but when I select to delete it, the confirm delete notification pops up on the phone. So it is not possible to complete the entire delete email operation from the watch.This works correctly with the Gmail application but it doesn't have a confirm delete prompt. I suppose one option would be to disable the confirm delete dialog entirely or to disable it for just the phone.Working out the most desirable behavior for using a watch to dispatch the email is the first step. I have only had this watch a few weeks and am still getting used to it. K-9 I have used for a couple of years and am very happy with. AndroidWear is just a brave new world to figure out the Right Thing To Do (tm). :)""",enhancement+,98
"Updating score from 2 to 5.  All bugs that I experienced have been ironed out. Much better email client than the original on my Sammy Notetab. I love the new icon it's better than the previous. Very modern design, love it. Happy New Year all.",_,0
Love this mail client. But what have the devs been smoking when choosing this new icon? Please revert to the old one.,_,0
Love the app. Don't love the new icon.,_,0
Love this app. Perfect for handling multiple email accounts on the phone without any of the hassle that most of the other apps bring with them.,_,0
"I really love this app, it keeps all my email accounts in one place which helps keep up with the daily. I have been using it for a while and on a couple of different devices, but the new icon really sucks. I'd love to have the old one back, that would make it perfect and worth all five stars to me, since the icon was much cleverer and more befitting of the inspiration and this app. Thanks.",_,0
Used for years on old phone. Have new phone on android 7 now no notifications despite reinstalling,_,0

"Great email client. I love the configurability of the message list. Preview lengths, gravatars etc. Works flawlessly with OpenKey-chain for email encryption.",_,0
I love the efficiency of K9 Email,_,0
I love that i can set custom notifications and can delete all 3000 emails at once. I also love the easiness of maneuvering through it. EDIT: after Nougat i can no longer rely on K9 as syncing somehow seems to be disabled. I've been missing a lot of important emails due to it. Had to uninstall,_,0
Have been using this simple but well-crafted and quick email app for several years and find it most handy on the Android phone. The price is right too (grin).,_,0
"Great, works good with GMX. I love it,!",_,0
"Won't delete emails from the servers anymore. I delete an email from my phone but when I go to my email online they're all still there. Also, won't delete from the pop up anymore either. 🙁",_,0
"Used on S3mini for 3 years, S4mini 3 years,  now S5mini, Works well on all.  Shame no 'Swipe to Delete' tho'.",_,0
"I used to love this app but last couple of updates have made some really annoying changes. Have to scroll to bottom of rcvd email to see attachments, some emails will show in inbox but when try to open K9 closes down, sync doesn't seem to work properly now, will go hours without getting new messages and loads come in together, and pictures in mails don't always show properly. Please give me older version back, I used to love it!!!",_,99
Really well designed app. Love it. I never give 5 stars,_,0
K9 email is efficient and secure I love the pgp support. Makes it easy for a privacy freak like me to love and a novice to use. I have never seen better programming on any os.,_,0
Love it! My favorite email app!,_,0
"4 years of happy mobile mail :) This is an outstanding email app! It works perfectly, super customizable! Also has a very unique  and comfortable interface. It's that simple to describe it, nothing else to say, really, because it's  just great! Last year, when I bought a new phone, i didn't even try its own mail client app because i got used to k9 a lot. Thanks for your great app and amazing support!",_,0
"Love it I love k9, it doesn't bother me with cloud-nonsense and it's free!",_,0
"Keeps stopping Used to be great, but now crashes (stops) several times each day on my new phone. Getting ready to uninstall if not resolved soon.",_,0
My go-to email app.. Extremely useful. Would love to see a desktop version!,_,0
Great app Almost 3 years I using it. Love it..,_,0
"Great email client Far better than the standard android email client. Slick, responsive, functional and stable. Used it on and off for years!  I do keep trying the new standard versions when I get a new device, but always end up installing k9!",_,0
Used to be good I used to live the app but now I get emails sporadically even though my phone is set to push. Finding another more reliable email app.,_,0
Was great... Until I stopped receiving notifications so had to uninstall and use a different app. Was working fine on LG Flex but now on Huawei Mate7. Love the options though.,_,0
"Best Free eMail App I've been using K-9 for a couple of years now and it is simply a must have. It can be challenging to set up but once you do, it works great. As a UX engineer, I notice a few pain points but I'm happy to use it. I recently migrated to a new phone and tried the export/import process. Happy to say it was a success! Thanks K-9 team...",_,0
Amazing! I've used K-9 for almost nine months and I love it! Super powerful and is rock solid. F/LOSS FTW!,_,0
"The bees knees. All the other clients may have plenty of bling, but none is as powerful. Would love some updates of the UI, but once you get used to it, it doesn't even matter any more and there's no going back.",_,0
"Used to love it, but too slow I've used k9 for several years, and generally really liked it. Over the past couple of years, though, it has simply gotten too slow to be functional. Opening a message takes several seconds, as does returning to the message list. I didn't know if it was my phone ( note 2), my server, or k9. I just downloaded aqua, and though I haven't used it enough to know if I actually like it, it seems to do the trick and opens messages quickly.",_,0
"I've used this app for years to view my email via my tablet and smartphone. I've had few problems with it and it performs solidly. The only issue I've had is with sending email using ssl. Sometimes, the email won't sync because the certificate is ""invalid"" as it states. Simply resending the email usually resolves the issue. However, the message is not apparent as it doesn't pop up in the app. You have to watch for it in your notifications.",_,0
Delete The app is great and I use it for work constantly the one complaint I do have is that the delete button needs to be moved from the center of the bottom row. It is entirely too easy to delete important email. Thinking you're closing the app. Even with the option to validate it occurs. This would certainly be a 5 star review if that change was made.,_,0
I love this app! A few minute tweaks and ite would be perfect.,_,0
Doctor Who Love Doctor Who!!! The app is also great,_,0
"WOW, WHAT AN APP! I love this APP, it works really great & doesn't give you to many problems!!!   I have an older Samsung & it works very well on my phone!",_,0

The Best one I love this app..,_,0
Great App Love this email client.  Works with 3 of my 4 accounts perfectly.,_,0
I love this app Thanks to developer... I love k9 dogs and I love this app.. Its simple and clean.. I used my mail for 2 days and then I found this app... You guys are rocking... CHEERS,_,0
"Practically perfect in every way I love this app, so much better than the standard email application.",_,0
Lovely but one L it to snag that makes this up useless for me if I attach a document to an email I must open it ;many time to modicum one or two details and most of the time to confirm that I att the right document. Add is it is a no go.,_,0

Almost Perfect! Please add a delete option to the notifications please.,_,0
No frills email client Love the ease of use.,_,0
Love it Been using it about a year now. Simple and easy. Love it.,_,0
"Great application But there's something I'd love:  Either give me an option to stop seeing notifications if I'm connected to a certain wifi network, or stop notifications on certain times. If I'm at home, I see my mails anyways, so hearing the notification sounds all the time is bothering and a bit pointless. I would love to disable them when I'm connected to my home wifi.",_,0
"I love this app I finally found a simple email app for my Android tablet. I don't need anything fancy. I just want to read my email, reply and delete them without a big production. This one allows me enough customizations but is still simple and straight forward.",_,0
"Used to love it But it doesn't work with 2 step encryption now, can't even log in...",_,0
Great I can't believe I have not reviewed this! I have used it on my GNEX for a couple of years and it was great! I'm having a minor problem with notifications on my S5 but it could be me.,_,0
"Good, but... Can't  delete from within an email. Annoying.",_,0
Swipe to delete Love the sheer amount of customisation available and how polished this app is. But I really can't pull myself away from the Gmail app just yet due to one simple missing feature. Swipe to delete!,_,0
"Great App I love this App, but Hotmail does not love it! This is what I said before. ""I just started using this. Feels and looks great. Hope I can keep using it w/o any bugs!""",_,0
"Used to love this app It had been my go to email app for through 3 android phones.  Supports my pebble watch.  Sadly I use it mainly to view attachments send by my security camera.   It now requires me to click download compete message, show attachment, etc etc.   What a tedious process just to see my attachments.   Thank you for all the years but I have moved on.",_,0
Perfect! I have used this app for a couple of years now. It has never failed on me!,_,0

Really usefull app. I love it!,_,0

I love it Please provide Apple ios s version also... I love to have it in my iPad,_,0
"I have used this app with every phone I've had since 2010, and I love everything about it.  My only complaint about the most recent version is that you took away the check boxes.  I used to be able to check multiple emails to delete them in one action.  Now I have to delete each one individually.  Is there a way to turn this functionality back on and I missed it?  Thanks.",_,0
"Looks nice but not user friendly Looks really nice with some good features, but no way to delete emails unless you hold down on the email till a popup appears with the option to delete.  If it had a way to check off each email to be selected for deletion, I would give it 5 stars. As it is now, its just not worth using",_,0

Don't like the new update I wasn't even given a choice of whether or not to install it. You can no longer delete several emails at once. Very time consuming to open each email to delete it. I find the color coded letters distracting. I wish there was a way to turn it off.,_,0
Latest update please undo What would make you think there would be overwhelming interest in adding the return email addresses of all the junk mail received to the contact list?  More over why that in place of the select button that allowed us to delete a group of emails concurrently?  I don't have time to open and delete each unsolicited commercial email I receive individually... guess I'll be looking for a new email app in my spare time again.  &lt; frustrated Sigh!&gt;,_,0
"5 stars if you add delete It's a fantastic email app. The only thing that would make it better would be to have a delete option from the pull down menu. I can reply and mark it read, but I can't delete. That's the only thing that's missing.",_,0
Used K-9 for about a year now It's about the most functional email client I've used. It doesn't look as clean as other apps but for me just works.   There are a lot of manual settings to get it working just right.,_,0
Love it Just reinstalled app after a few months of new phones. Nice to have you back!,_,0
New update fail Used to be a 5 * app. Ugly giant tiles added in this revision are terrible.  Thankfully you can disable them.,_,0
"Great on my phone, but does not sync to my Smart watch. No matter how many emails I receive, the Smart watch only displays 'List empty'.  Any advice/comments?",_,0
"Great email app! (Nexus 5) I just switched from iOS to Android and this app made that switch easier. Set up is super easy. Syncs with iCloud email FLAWLESSLY! Push works great. If I delete an email from the app on my phone it deletes off my native email program on my MacBook Air just like it did when I had an iPhone. I tried the stock Android app, evomail and cloudmagic but K9 is THE best. Thank you so much devs. Also, color led notifications for each mailbox and a combined mailbox view are super awesome features.",_,100
Used this for years. Only wish archived messages were collapsed when viewing from phone.,_,0

"Cannot trust any Android mail app ...not even this one, though it seems to be the best of a bad batch. Do not use K-9 if you have more than a few hundred messages in your email system.

In any case, use of IMAP is hindered, because the app seems to try to read the whole messages prior to showing them in the folder, even if you tell it not to. On a fast internet connection, this was gonna take hours to show the thousands of emails in my inbox. Search options seem limited... search whole messages, or... ? Whole messages then.

"""Allow another identity to be marked as the Sender of emails from an identityI have searched for existing issues, some relate to identities (e.g. #1117 or #935), but they are not addressing my problem/need.I would like to be able to use K9 the way I use Outlook user agent on my PC (and then be able to finally get rid off it!): in the from field, write any email address I want and have the mail sent with this address as """"From:"""".When I use a K9 identity, the smtp server of my mail host (one.com) rejects the mail (error 554 5.7.1), but again, it works when I use Outlook. Why?I had a look in the headers of a successfully sent message (from Outlook UA): the From is what I typed, but the Sender is my regular email account with which I authenticate on the SMTP server. I am pretty fine with this. I would suspect K9 maybe puts my 'From' address in the 'Sender' header as well, which would cause the error, or maybe does not set it at all (I tried to see the headers of a rejected email (from K9), I haven't seen the Sender tag, but it had not been sent, so...), which would be treated the same way.I have also spotted something strange: in the rejected email's headers, the message-ID was built with the domain of the From address, not the one of my actual SMTP account ('Sender'), maybe is it also a possible cause.Why all this? I own my domains, and I have set up specific sub-domains for emails. I can put anything before the '@', and I will get emails sent to it (kind of catch-all, but with rules behind). That way, I don't have to actually 'create' aliases (cumbersome), I can provide an arbitrary one any time, and it will work (most of the time, name/company/website@...). I can therefore spot when one of these addresses is misused and create a rule to trash all mails received through it if needed.However, this solution does not allow me to 'send' mails, except with the Outlook UA. I haven't found an Android UA capable of this (and I have tested a lot of them). I would just love if K9 was able to do it, either by default, or as an extra option in the identity settings.Please confirm how K9 handles the identities: as long as there is no SMTP settings per identity (I am personally not interested in this feature), it would seem logical to me that the Sender header (and message-ID) derive from the SMTP account being used to authenticate, not from the From header coming from the identity From email address, wouldn't it?K-9 Mail version: 5.203Android version: 6.0.1Account type  IMAP""",enhancement+,106

"Seems good, but idiotic setup On the plus side, it was very easy to add email accounts.  On the minus side, the setup was badly designed. Conflict ? Maybe, but for some reason the setup procedure picks up EVERY folder AND file on your host - in my case creating 4 times as many ""email"" accounts that actually existed. I suspect maybe a bug ?  So, for example, if you have a FILE on your server called myFile.php K9 picks this up as another email folder ! Seriously bad bit of design there. You have to manually select each error and mark it as ""2nd class"" to hide it (no multi-select option) - there is no apparent way to tell K9 to actually remove it.  Another issue - minor, but irritating - is if you click on an email with the intention of opening it, instead of opening it you instead get a list of emails from the same person. OK, so you can then click on the email AGAIN in this new list to actually ropen it but what an un-necessary step. Not a disaster, just annoying.

It neither stores them in a local internal address book nor offers to add them to contacts. This is a very undesirable behaviour / deficiency.

"For years, this was the best Android mail app available. It's unbelievable how the current developers have ruined such a fantastic email utility. Many of the old behaviors have been modified to work in unintuitive ways, demonstrating a lack of basic user ergonomics. The Unified Inbox in particular is a catastrophe. Now, unread messages show before read messages regardless of date or time. Read messages do not show at all (they completely disappear from Unified Inbox) UNLESS YOU READ THEM WITH ANOTHER CLIENT (such as your desktop PC). If you read a message with another client, it will appear below the list of unread messages, completely out of time/date order. The Unified Inbox worked perfectly in older versions, but whoever has been modifying the code for this section of K-9 is essentially incompetent.   There should be settings to configure the Unified Inbox behavior back to the old method if a user prefers that. It is after all the reason most of us switched to K9 in the first place. But the current behavior of showing messages read on another client in one way, and messages read in K-9 in another way, is just extremely poor development, and it needs to be fixed.",_,120

"Clean and quick. But bug-ridden. To test K-9 I added only my Exchange (WebDav) account. Connection was flawless, and data was read fast. I went to the Unified Inbox and there was my Exchange email. I started to explore, and went into the inbox for the Exchange account. At this point, the messages were downloaded again. Returning to the Unified Inbox, all of the messages were duplicated--two of each. I checked the folder list under the Exchange account and there are two inboxes listed. Why? I uninstalled and reinstalled... messages get duplicated in the same folder. It's ridiculous. Then I added another account, used the ""move up"" option to rearrange the accounts in the list, and it *duplicated* the account!",_,0

Now with my Moto G3 the app shuts down over and over, reading emails, loading, sending, but mostly switching between email accounts. Really sucka because I've been using K9 for quite some time and it is the best email app there is. Well it WAS until I updated phones. Sad that K9 mail isn't able to handle the upgrade.",_,0

"Not polling Has been working great for years, now all of the sudden it will not poll my emails - love the app, but if it doesn't work will have to uninstall....",_,0
"Would be great but The problem with the app is that when refreshing email it frequently gets stuck polling a folder. This was draining my battery a lot so I changed it to check for messages only when I manually do so. I often have to close the app, restart it then hit refresh again to get my email. A bug that hid messages behind white recently was fixed according to release notes. Nexus 4 w/ lollipop",_,0
Wont send emails out! Now since upgrade has nothing but numbers and symbols  I will not upgrade again! Sucks now!,_,0
"Went from amazing to awful Each upgrade seems to make it slower and more bloated, frequent errors and freezing issues are a daily occurrence",_,0
"Last version upgrade is awful I used to love this app, now I hate it. With the latest version it freezes constantly and takes forever to load mail folders. It crashes and doesn't remove deleted items from the inbox until I exit and go back into the app. Sometimes only new mail is displayed in the inbox, other times all the mail with no rhyme or reason. Very frustrating since it was much better.",_,0
Boo. Can't send email with the new upgrade. Very disappointed.,_,0
Upgrade broke it Now getting cert error.,_,0

Don't like the recent upgrade Great email client but this upgrade changed many of my options/settings. Hassle!!,_,0

"Could be nice if only... Every time you try to read messages, there's a hair trigger ""pull to refresh"" function that sends it into a loop of expensive data polling - no way to shut it off. Nearly useless as is and this is apparently a deliberate addition to what could've been a very nice program.",_,0
"Fixed KitKat bugs Thank you K9!  After the Kitkat ""upgrade"" couldn't display pic  attachments on regularly used email app on Nexus 7.  K9 allows me to display them again.  KitKat upgrade also caused messages to be deleted on the server after deleting them on Nexus.  K9 fixed that problem too..Also didn't have a ""select all"" feature and had to tap each email to select and delete.  K9 took care of that too!  Easy to use and set up!  Thank you for a great product.",_,0
"One stop email client! If your looking for one email client to access several webmail accounts (pop3, imap, exchange, etc) than this is it!  Latest upgrade pushes it to a 4.5! May improve the quiet time feature so stops sync during selected times, which would make it awesome! (If I'm correct in understanding how the feature works)   Keep up the great work.",_,0
"Very nice improvement! OK, originally had a problem with this upgrade, the SEND function was moved, and there was no documentation showing how to send a msg.

"An excellent email client that I have been using for years on various Android devices and through many different Android versions. Thanks a lot to the developers for their continuing work.

"K9 on galaxy nexus 4.2.2 slow after update - fixed. I'm running 4.2.2 on a verizon galaxy nexus phone and after the last K9 update K9 was dog slow reading emails... like 20s reaction time.  The advice about RECREATE DATA worked for me like a charm.  K9 is great once again!  From the list of your email messages press the back/up (180 degree turn symbol) and the next menu up should have your account name. That's the one to press to get the menu with RECREATE DATA.  As is warned, the local copy of your mail will be gone and hopefully redownloaded.  Worked for me at least.  And K9 response is now quicker then before the update.",_,126
"Update sucks - Appearance and Categories I have used this app for years and updated it last night.  The Gmail categories (which were not selected on my gmail) were added to K9, which sucks!

Other than that, love the app.  :o)  For now, 3 stars.",_,0

"Slow The previous version loaded the list of emails slow. The latest version does everything slow. Loading email,  selecting email,  deleting email,  etc.  Everything.

"K-9 Mail used to be really good, but it has gone downhill of late... Among other things, it suddenly stopped working with my (IMAP) e-mail servers (despite the fact that they work everywhere else!) and the only response from the developers (via github) is ""we are working on improving the error messages"". Unfortunately, I can't wait around for the developers to fix whatever it is they broke - particularly seeing as the comments on github suggest this might not be addressed for a while... If you want something Open Source and K-9 Mail works for you, stick with it as it's the best Open Source offering out there; if you don't care about Open Source or K-9 Mail is not working for you too, well there's plenty of proprietary alternatives out there.",_,127

It's a great alternative to Google's email client that comes with Android, for those of you who are concerned about  privacy online.

"Good app and big + for it being open source, but the lack of multi message select puts me personally off :(",_,0

The UI is so terrible here that I find the entire app unusable. Uninstalling and now in search of something that was made for use by people other than the developers.",_,0
"Definitely a must for people who maintains more than two email addresses. One good thing is that when set up properly, it downloads the contents of your email locally - including the attachments.",_,0
"As of 10/2/2014 this app is unusable.  All I get are cert errors.  No way to get it to stop.  My hosting providers cert does not match my domain name, but most email apps allow you to ignore this.

"On the road to perfection First off, it's open source and you can build your own app from source files hosted on GitHub. Secondly, its a 'proper' email client with non of the useless bells and whistles you see on other email clients (looking at you Gmail). Lastly, as of version 5.2, it now supports PGP/MIME (need the OpenKeyChain).  Gets better with each update.",_,0

"""Message Send Failed """"Signing requested, but no key selected!""""On the current git HEAD, on a device without any PGP apps installed, composing and then sending a message fails with a toast saying """"Signing requested, but no key selected!"""".  The effect of this is that e-mails can't ever be sent.Looking at the code this seems to be due to [line 51 of RecipientPresenter.java](.  which checks `isMissingSignKey()` which is true when `signingKeyId` is `null` in the current `cryptoStatus`.  If no PGP app is installed that value will always be `null`.I think the proper solution would be to have `isMissingSignKey()` also check if `cryptoStatus.cryptoMode` is `CryptoMode.DISABLE` and also set the `currentCryptoMode`, which currently defaults to `CryptoMode.OPPORTUNISTIC`, to default to `CryptoMode.DISABLE` as users without OpenPGP can't even open the menu to change modes.The following commit shows what I propose: . I didn't see anywhere that the current code saves a preference for `currentCryptoMode`.

Usually they come in form of mail attachments with .ics extension.So in effect this is tightly coupled to email and it deserves dedicated handling.Desired features:- filter inbox by emails containing attachment with *.ics name (sometimes there is more than one attachments in one email, but if at least one of them is calendar invite that we want to highlight this email)- preview of the invite displaying the basic details of the invite- automatic parsing - auto-add to built-in calendar, or at least suggest auto-adding with one click confirmationRight now you have to manually open the attachments with *.ICS extension with default MIME handler which is build-in calendar app.This is time consuming and it easy to miss the invite.Another downside is that such manual opening of the attachment automatically adds the meeting to calendar which is problematic when you want to reject it or it is added at some distant date making it difficult to locate/identify.send to yourself calendar invites from:- Android calendar- iPhone/Apple calendar- Microsoft Exchange calendarK-9 Mail version: 5.1Android version:5Account type IMAP and POP3""",enhancement+,130

"""key-aware recipient chooserFor sending of encrypted mail, the recipient picker should be crypto-aware. There are a couple of things to consider, and some design choices to make. Let's-a go:So first off, the material way to go is [chips](.  There are a couple of libraries for that, in OpenKeychain we use [TokenAutoComplete](.  which is mature and flexible but not quite material-design. There are also libraries based on Google's internal chips library from the GMail app, like [android-chips](.  but those aren't really made to be anything else but regular contact pickers and I havn't found one which looked mature. Since material design in k-9 isn't really there yet anyways, I would go with the more established and maintained option here, i.e. TokenAutoComplete.So, what do we actually want to show in the list? At the moment, a list of e-mail addresses (not contacts) is shown, queried from `ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Email`. This is the obvious thing to show, and it seems more reasonable than a list of contacts so I would just keep it that way. What I would like to add is an annotation to each address about its crypto-status.In OpenKeychain, we have icons to show the key status - a green checkmark, yellow question mark, and some red ones for revoked/expired/unsuitable for operation. The problem is, outside of an explicit crypto context, it's not clear that these icons are about the status of some encryption key, so we really can't use them here. We also don't need info about special states of a key - revoked or expired keys are simply irrelevant for recipient selection.My proposal would be to use Threema's concept: Three dots, with three states """"one in red"""" / """"two in yellow"""" / """"three in green"""", all others greyed out. Check out ma [mock-up](.  The idea is to be mildly alarming (""""just one of three""""), but also suggest a way to progress (""""key available, two out of three"""", """"verified that thing, three out of three!"""").A different approach would be a lock in different states (red/yellow/green with open / closed+questionmark / closed+checkmark), but I'm a) missing the progress aspect of the three-dots concept, and b) an open red lock next to each mail address is just a tad too alarming - if the UI tells the user """"this is unsafe!"""", they might just migrate to a different program which is equally unsafe but does nothing to inform the user about that fact.Some more thoughts:- if a valid (or even confirmed) key is available, the user will likely want to encrypt - optimize for that.- encryption without signing is not a reasonable use case and I would not support it.- pgp/mime vs pgp/inline is an orthogonal problem to everything mentioned here, I would leave it for later- do we need a contact-picker-button? the gmail app removed theirs recently. If we do, the information it displays should be identical to the dropdown.""",enhancement+,131

Swift I really like the simple design. You can view multiple email accounts at once.

"Powerful and Easy to use After trying so many e-mail apps, this is by far the best! If you have more than one e-mail account do yourself a favour and install this one.  I need to juggle a half dozen accounts and the app handles it better than every other app I've tried. Good customization and ability to handle different accounts differently. I can set auto refresh to different times for each account, set different notifications, etc.  I am impressed with this app, I have made this my primary e-mail over my PC based one.",_,0
"Mostly pretty satisfied. I can have all my e-mail accounts in one place and check them once in a while, answer them, organise them, save drafts, upload images and so on. However I don't get notifications upon receiving new e-mails nor do the appear in the inbox unless I manually click or motion for a refresh. I initially didn't care as I wanted to avoid using mobile data but I am now getting more data and don't care when I am on WiFi. So I activated background sync when auto-sync is checked ( which it is).",_,136

Poor visual design takes away from the greatness. Maybe its because I am a  graphic designer but this design literally gets worse the more you use this app. I mean it needs a sleeker icon. I ignore bad icons but geeez. This is hideous. Lots of apps have different icons to pick for each apk. It needs something simple and contemperary The gray buttons are not cohesive with the white selection interface and the text is offset. It bugs me a little.,_,0

"""New Feature request: command line to execute before stablishing connections towards the e-mail serverHello,For me it would be very useful the application to have the possibility to store, for every account, an optional field (command line to execute before stablishing the connection towards the email server).This field would contain a command line which would be executed before trying to connect to the email server.In my case, this would be useful, because I am planning to use fwknop in the linux server where I will have the email server.The fwknop functionality gives you the possibility to close all ports of your server until the server receives an appropiate combination of tcp messages. In such a case, the fwknop server would create firewall rules to open the port requested for a few seconds.In these few seconds, the client can connect to the server because the ports are open.fwknop2 is an application available in Android as open source code.I suppose this fwknop2 application could be modified to have the possibility of being invoked to send the fwknop messages from the command line, and then, using the new feature just requested for k-9, open the ports before attemting to connect to the email server.```---------```1.2.3.K-9 Mail version:           For new versionsAndroid version:            For all versionsAccount type            For all account typesP.D.I suppose you are very busy with other implementations.In this case, I could offer my services to try to program this request.Although I am not very familiar with Android, I have quite experience programming with Java and I think I could succeed with this development.Please, let me know what do you think about it.Kind regards,Fran.

"Good app, but always leaves connections open making it unusable While I liked K-9 for all the features that it has and it's new interface, ultimately my IT department made me and a coworker stop using it because my account always had a ton of IMAP connections left open and it would connect with new ones.    Similar things happen with other emails like gmail.

Greatest mail app there is... But I must add to the chorus... BRING BACK THE OLD ICON... One star for the new horrible icon.,_,0
"Good email app. Wonder why the K9 dog icon now has a red envelope over it all of a sudden though? I don't like it....that's why 4 stars now. Actually, I hate the icon. Please change it back. Will uninstall if not changed ASAP. Please fix! 1 star until you do :(",_,0
"OK, joining the others. I hate the new icon so much it's one star until you change it back. I emailed but didn't get any response.",_,0
"Great email client, wouldn't use anything else. Missing one star due to lack of printing feature and now ugly icon.",_,0
"Good email program, I have used it for years. Minus 1 star for new butt ugly icon, what a shame.",_,0
"5 star reduced to 1 star.  It was bad enough when Ctrl-A would open the address book rather than Select All.  Now Ctrl-C is broken.  Rather than Copy, it pops up some stupid dialog about encryption.  What's next?  Will Ctrl-X summon Wolverine and Ctrl-V vacuum my floor?  Tried using the requested Bug Report site but that was just a jumble of developer speak and not at ALL end-user friendly.",_,0
"Star icon is covered by the scroll bar, so I always scroll to unwanted location when trying to change the star rating.",_,0
"SORT THE SYNCHRONISATION OUT. PLEASE. IT IS LITERALLY THE KEY FUNCTION OF AN EMAIL CLIENT -LETTING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NEW EMAIL. I should not have to manually check. Taking another  star off because comments are being ignored. Also, what's with the new - and rather babyish - logo? The original was rather smart. Can we have it back please?",_,0
"Good for interfacing with different mail services, very good pgp. Only withholding the fifth star because I have to enable sign only every time I send.",_,0
Quite good. Pity the scroll bar and star overlap so you scroll fifty messages down when you try to star one. Why do new versions get delayed on Google compared to F-Droid?,_,0
"The scroll bar on the right overlaps the message stars, which makes this app unusable if you need to star and unstar messages. Is anyone from the K9 project using their own app?",_,0
"Absolutely fabulous Feature packed and open source, what's not to like? The only bad thing I can think of is the lame one star reviews from ungrateful and entitled pathetic losers that are not able to use the issue tracker.",_,0
Star Brilliant mail app that ahead of its time lord. A small issue with the favourites starin the message list. It is placed over the message list slide so when you try to select the star the app moves the message list down the page. Forcing me to go into each message to add the star. Would be great if you could move the star over to the left side under the multi select boxes so they can be used in the same manner to avoid this frustration. Each a bit bigger would also be great for easier selection problems.,_,143
"Have loved the app in the past, but last update broke some important things. This is on my Samsung 12.1 tablet. First, it no longer displays the subject line above the current message, now just the send and receive addresses.   Second, zooming in and scrolling in an email is broken.  Would love to go back to a 5 star review, hopefully a (tested) fix is coming soon.",_,0
"Does not tell me i have mail And no way to contact the developers.  I love the idea and i hate to 1 star K9, but an email app with no way to fetch mail is pointless.",_,0
Good An excellent app. Simple yet functional. The level of  utility is awesome.  Have used it consistently for years across several devices. I take away one star bcoz of security concerns raised by google. All my main mailboxes are google...,_,0
"Good app, but can't click star to favorite Clicking star causes interface to scroll, even when scrollbar fades away. Otherwise, fantastic app. Used it since 2008, and wouldn't trade it.",_,0
"The scroll button on the right is activated when attempting to ""star"" an email. Also am unable to save attachments to internal or external storage. HTC A9 on Marshmallow.",_,0
"Awesome app, but unable to star emails I've used this ever since i got my first android phone over five years ago, and love it. The only thing that could be better is a fix for starring emails - when tapping the star on an email, it scrolls the interface instead.",_,0
"Love it, but there's one annoying thing You can't use the star on the right side to star a message, because you will hit the hitbox of the scrollbar and scroll to that position. Works neither in portrait nor in landscape mode :( besides that, the app is truly amazing !",_,0

Won't work with Yahoo or Gmail With Yahoo and Gmail I get not the right user name or password. Tried web address for problems no place to send issue request. Works go on pop3 and Hotmail. Will change star if fixed.,_,0
Printing My previous email app was just standard ( boring ) This app looks grest and easy to set up and mannage. I would love to give it a 5 star but i cant figure out how to print an email. My other app was easy. I have a galaxy note 4. I want to keep this app but I may have to switch to another that has printing capabilities,_,0
"error show in mailbody after downlod the mail when open the mail ""Download complete message"" shown below the mailbody.its very irritating.",_,0
Great app Only thing missing for me is the ability to swipe between emails which makes me take a star away,_,0
Hard to beat Would be 5 stars but not supporting the Android pop up window function takes one star away.,_,0
Scrolling issue When trying to add a star to an email it scrolls down the page for no apparent reason.,_,0
"Please fix I would give 5 star, but the lack of info in the ""failed to send some messages""  error is frankly quite annoying! Please fix this to show why it failed.",_,0
"Great email client for Android, if you have the skill and patience to set up your IMAP accounts manually.  Ability to adjust FONT size is limited when using on a Tablet.  On a high-res screen, you'll need your magnifying reading glasses.    I'm running K9 on my Chromebook via the Google ARC Welder re-packaging environment.  It works well except you can't deal with attachments because K9 doesn't know how to deal with the Chrome OS file system.  (Chrome OS is lacking a complete email client for combining email accounts.)    Build a Chrome OS version, and give us older folks larger fonts and this would be a five star app.",_,0
Used to be a 5 star app Used to be 5 stars before the update. It's now very sluggish on my Note 4 running Lollipop. Still usable but not as slick as before.,_,0
"Do not like updated version. Buttons at top on new big phones not good. Share hard to get to and not availiable in message list view. Scroll cursor in the way of star botton. Try to star a message and scrolls instead. Phone numbers not clickable or hyperlinked. Bad deal for a cell phone app. All these things are very frustrating on the Galaxy s5. All worked great with old version on Evo 4g. Use them all the time and makes me want to find a new app. Have to also get emails sent to stock email to call, then go to K9 to fight and share.",_,144
Only 3 stars... Only 3 stars since you still haven't fixed the bug that makes the message list scroll when I click on the star for a message.,_,0
My favourite email client I will give one more star when someone tells me how I can change the default font in my sent emails. I just hate Times New Roman.,_,0
I use stars a lot and it is frustrating the star and scroll bar overlap each other.  I thought I didn't have this problem before in old version(can't remember whst version it was)...,_,0
Great app I just gave this app a one star before realizing there was an update fixing links in an email,_,0
"Neither of the two issues highlighted ago has been fixed 😐 Tapping the star on the right hand side in list view will cause the list to scroll. Also, progress bar when downloading an attachment would be welcome. Half the time I get the impression nothing is happening, and often nothing actually is...nevermind guys, switched to AquaMail, it's like moving from 2006 to 2015. It was nice while it lasted.",_,0
Scrollbar & Star I'm using xperia z1. The only problem is the 'star' is too close to the scrollbar on the left. This make me scroll along my mail list when I want to add 'star' to a mail. Otherwise the app is the best mail app I have tried.,_,0
Still good app but...all my emails marked with star keep disappearing after one day. Why? I thought its permanent marker. Fix it and you've got 5 🌟,_,0
Doesn't work again. 5 stars when it works.  1 star if it doesn't work at all.  It works great 50% of the time..certificate errors the rest of the time.,_,0
Great Aplication No issues with the application and have been using for more than 3years on various android phones.   Would be great if we can have an auto filter option available to filter important mails directly.   Please have this incorporated and would love to rate it a 5 star app.,_,0
"Great app Was 5 , now 1 star. Can't send email with newest update.",_,0
"Was perfect, was 5 star The most recent update sends error notifications for no reason, and has some other issues too",_,0
"Reliable, Robust Next best thing to Thunderbird on a desktop. -1 star due to Needs ability to move email across IMAP accounts.",_,0
"Update messed up Was a 5-star app until the update. Now it causes errors with my Yahoo accounts. Please fix this, otherwise I need to search for a new mail app.",_,0
"Not working since last update Hi Team, Please release a working update asap. Since last update the mail is not working even with gmail.  Please the apps 5 star status :-)",_,0
"5.0RC1 almost certainly not ready for prime time. I love this app and it's great for what I use it for -- multiple secure IMAP connections, including one to a fussy MSExchange service. But the latest version here stores HUGE numbers of ""Exception: message count -1 for folder XXX"" and I/O errors and PUSH errors in the K9 Errors folders -- and these aren't errors. They're what happen when you walk around with a mobile device and change wifi speeds, access points, and cell towers. And those exceptions now take up space in your message storage for the app. Also they've discontinued the option for older security methods -- and that's great for security, except when you have to turn security OFF because you can't personally upgrade the server you have to use. I may have to downgrade to maintain usability for my needs, but in all I'm very happy with this app and the hard work from the development team to keep this a five-star product.",_,145
"Was perfect, was 5 star The most recent update sends error notifications for no reason, and has some other issues too",_,0
Upgrade broke the app Will return to a 5 star when fixed.,_,0
"Great app but... Since the last update even when I read an email, 2 minutes later it says the email is unread. Only gave it one star to attract attention to this issue. This is a 5 star app otherwise and has been perfect in the past. I easily imported all my settings from my previous phone. Good feature",_,0
Email not syncing Great app but the push functionality isn't working. I have to manually refresh the inbox for messages. I have not changed any settings from the default install. Does it push mail from Hotmail? I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 LTE. Would be 5 star otherwise.,_,0
"big improvements The app has gone through a number of struggles as they moved to the new view / model, but has gotten much faster and reliable. Excellent product once again-> moving my 1 star to 5.",_,0
Good app: Can improve Very user friendly and intuitive.  Conversation mode is missing. Need confirmation before send.   It is a must and should be included in next release for a 5 star.,_,0
"Could have been a five star After months of using it just stop working, thank you for services :(",_,0
"Fix the scroll bar! It is impossible to star a  message without triggering the scroll bar. Even after the scroll bar hides, if you try to star a message, it will re-activate. Please fix!",_,0
"Good but Good but when downloading attachment in email, can't see whether downloading or not,if you can put something like line to show download you 'll get 5+.",_,0
"Updated review figured how to disable new looks. Still poor taste. Finally figured how to remove the nee ""features"" that mimics gmail or bbm.     Never should have been required to do that in the first place.  Permanent 2 star loss.",_,0
Good but also awkward Worked perfectly for my school email until it was changed to a Google host. Now funky in syncing and message layout. Worst part is not being able to star messages without tripping the scroll bar. I have to go into each individual message to star them.,_,0
"Been a K9 user for 3 yrs. Nice revised interface. Except the 'star' location overlaps the navigation bar on the right Also, it changes to gmail style contact icon isn't that good nor practical. For me, I can't recognize where it's from at a glance by only a first single letter shown, even a big RANDOM colored box is no help. Besides, 'star' colors in yellow instead of blue would be great",_,0
"Gr8 mail app, more like the bb interface Gr8 app, feel like my old blackberry mail. However, suddenly the new mail notifications started to disappear. Rectified after reinstalling, but had to make all changes to settings again. Hence 1 star less.",_,0
Sorry you lost one star The new update have imap sync troubles. You need update manually the mails in each folder.  Please check this valuable function.,_,0
One missing feature.... Conversation view....would be 5 star if it had that.,_,0
Obnoxious colored letters Get rid of the obnoxious large colored letters alerting the 1st letter of the senders email. I've looked for a way to turn it off but no luck. Give me a way to get rid of it and I'll 5 star the app.,_,0
Connection error? Often when I have an email that I need to 'Download complete message' I get a connection error and the email says 'no text'. This seems to happen randomly (will work with one email but not the next) but still keeps happening if I try again. I'm on full WiFi coverage at home so there is nothing wrong with my internet connection. How can I fix this? Or better yet is there a setting to make it automatically download the complete message?,_,146
"Love this app but.... Version 4.4 works brilliantly on my Samsung S3, no complaints at all which would give this 5 stars.... but this version is not compatible with my Asus Transformer TF300T which is why it loses a star.",_,0

"Reboot problem I've had the App for years and have been happy with it. Until the Android 5 update on my Note 3. After the update, my phone started crashing/rebooting about once a day. I spent weeks trying to track down the problem. I did a reset on my phone and re-installed my critical Apps and the problem was still present. It would happen even when the phone was sitting on charge overnight. I called AT&T, and they admitted that this was one of the problems they were seeing since the Android 5 update but all they could offer was a $100 phone replacement with no guarantee that this was solve the problem. Then I realized that it often happened when I was checking my email with K9. I removed K9, rebooted my phone, and it has only crashed once in the last 7 days. So, while there may be an underlying problem with Android 5,  it becomes a critical problem with K9 installed.",_,151

Secure  and open source. Secure. Security is priority in my book and for now this App meets the requirements. Other high rated Apps like Aqua mail have analytics in their App. Blue Mail another high rated App  has loop hole where your mail passes and can be held on their mail server. K9 mail is open source which means it can be inspected for security risk. Reviews on Internet show it to be safe and secure across the board. Not the best of interfaces but worthy trade off for me. It's free and secure. Well done K9.Thx,_,0

"""Wrong folder names for special-use folders with IMAP namespace prefixK9 seems to choose wrong names for special-use folders when the IMAP namespace has a prefix.I'm using a Dovecot Server with the following configuration:```namespace {  type=private  prefix = INBOX/  separator = /   inbox = yes   mailbox Trash {    auto = subscribe    special_use = \Trash  }  mailbox Drafts {    auto = subscribe    special_use = \Drafts  }  [...]}```With this settings, K9 correctly recognizes every folder: The folder names in the list of all folders are shortened by the namespace prefix and I get folders like """"Inbox"""", """"Junk"""" and e.g. """"Archives/2015"""". The real IMAP folder names are """"INBOX"""", """"INBOX/Junk"""" and """"INBOX/Archives/2015"""".K9 also reads the configured special-use flag but here, the namespace prefix isn't stipped. Instead of using e.g. the """"Junk"""" folder, K9 uses folders that are listed as e.g. """"INBOX/Junk"""" in K9 (due to prefix stripping) and are effectively named """"INBOX/INBOX/Junk"""".After setting up a new account in K9 with the server-settings mentioned above, the """"wrong"""" folder names are also visible in the settings: Under `Account settings -> Folders` the special folders are listed as e.g. """"INBOX/Junk"""" which redirects to the wrong folder as mentioned above. If you manually select the Junk folder, K9 will only display """"Junk"""" in the settings.**Note** that I'm not too deep into Dovecot configuration and therefore this could also be a wrong configuration in Dovecot.

Another app bites the dust Another application that worked brilliantly and was incredibly versatile. but is now broken and so buggy that it's unusable. If you have access to an older version use that. Unlikely that the security compromises will hit you in the older version but certain that the new bugs will make you delete the app altogether.

Latest update caused issues. I have been using K9 for my Yahoo email account for about 4 years.  I have a mail server at home which downloads and deletes my Yahoo emails (which is why I don't use Yahoo's app).  I have had the same exact settings on K9 since the beginning. Never had an issue. Now the latest K9 update has caused issues. I keep getting certificate error nag messages but the app still works.,_,0
Lastest update broke Yahoo certificates Keep getting certificate errors with latest update (v5.000).  Having to manually check settings to read mail on Yahoo mail servers is a pain.  Never had a problem before this update.  On Moto X with KitKat.,_,0

"Brilliant Just keeps getting better. Best way to manage any and all my emails, Ever.",_,0
"Really like this client K9 team, you have an awesome app. I would ask that you consider one enhancement.  When someone has to make back-to-back calls, the K9 app tries to sync every time data is available, not by the time interval requested by the user, delaying the ability to make calls. It causes me to turn off sync, which defeats the purpose of time intervals anyway. Thanks for a great app.",_,0
Product Declining Use to love the product but the sync of folders and search for emails is getting bad. Sometimes making me feel stupid infront of the customer cause I know I sent them an email and I can't find it on the phone even if I force load more emails. Come to my computer at the office and there is the email in the sent folder. Sync is getting bad. But for basic email the product is still good.,_,0
Crappy Connection error when trying to read 1 of my important emails. Yet it worked on gmail site.   All he new mail i get is blank. No text. Edit.  Used nearly all my mobile data.

Stucks This app doesn't update the yahoo email accounts automatically. The app has to be refresh every time to see the new emails.  One more thing i noticed which is missing is: it doesn't show is it up to date or not.   The application is getting stuck updating yahoo account drafts folder and never finishes until app is force stopped. This is costing battery and network data.,_,0
Ok...but It won't sync my mail for me...I have to do it manually. That is fine for those accounts that I don't need to check on a regular basis. Tried searching for help on how to fix that and found nothing. Guess I will be looking for a different email app.,_,0

Although not able to sync Sub-folders... has many useful features such as being able to fetch mail even if android is in stamina mode.

I've loved K-9 mail since I first got my Xperia but last update made it perfect! Right from notification bar new K-9 email can be selected and buttons on side let me choose  and delete individual mail. Color selections are fun too. Highly recommend. Sometimes my email arrives on phone before computers. Still working flawlessly on MOTO X2 - Lollipop!  New mail notifications always appear on lock screen (Nova launcher) and even show on watch (MOTO 360) so for the folks that aren't being notified I suggest checking your other app settings.  K9 mail even allows for replies by sliding down from notification bar!  I use my phone for business emails and K-9 Mail has never let me down.,_,202

Allow import of settings exported by newer version of the appCurrently we don't import settings files with a settings version number higher than our own. That means users often run into trouble when downgrading.Since we do strict input validation and discard unknown/invalid settings it shouldn't be a problem to allow the import of settings from a newer K-9 Mail version.,enhancement+,0

"I thought it was doing okay,  but Keeps crashing. Reduced rating down from 4.5 to 2.5. :( I'm Not willing to send report  because the Report button doesn't allow me to see what's being collected and for me to choose or approve.    I greatly appreciate being able to export settings, & receipts, & many other features.    Other than the need to fix crash problem,  I can only suggest 3 things:    1. Allow messages  to be date grouped in the Inbox with header title being a date;  like the way the default /stock email app does it on Samsung Galaxy phones.   2. Allow to only download headers;  again like default email app.   3. Allow emails to Not be synced/stored on phone.  Especially when setup as an IMAP connection.",_,211

Holds *all* the emails I've been happy with this for years now.  I'd give it 5 stars if you could compose emails in TrueType fonts rather than it just reading them.,_,0
Have to reinstall monthly Constantly deletes emails.  I will open up the app and 3-4 days of emails will be gone.  I have to reinstall it to get the emails back.  It's ridiculous.  The only reason I keep it is because it holds more email than my server and I like the layout.,_,0

If you're finding the other email clients a bit lacking/bare or you're finding it does not allow you to tailor the way you do email, give K9 a go. It hasn't disappointed me so far.",_,0
"Great, using it for years already I love this app, but it seems a recent update has moved the reply, reply all and forward buttons to a submenu in the menu: menu -&gt; send -&gt; reply.  That's tedious and it took me five minutes to find it :( Please change that back to buttons as before!  I'm on an Asus TF701t, the above is the case for landscape and portrait mode.",_,0
Top email client One of the few offering so many choices.  I needed it particularly for it's ability to add a reply to address option.  As it now adds group emails from contacts it is just superb.   Well done K9,_,0

Reply button Landscape reply button missing. Lame and totally inconvenient. Some ppl prefer typing replies in landscape only. This update defeats that and creates annoyance of landscape to portrait to reply and back to landscape to type. Software engineering 101 kindergarten. Why would they do this?  Defies logic!,_,0
Worked great. Was best app but It stopped sending me emails. Tried to reinstall but now won't let me connect. 3 emails to Dev ignored. Unless you jump through hoops and download software to bug report they won't help you. VERY disappointed. Great app poorly supported!,_,0
"Reply ability gone in landscape The reply button no longer exists in landscape mode? Seriously?  Also if someone sends me a group email and someone else replies, you more stick all those messages together in a folder and only show the most recent reply in my preview? You just caused me to run across town for a canceled meeting because the notice wasn't showing in my inbox, just someone else's irrelevant reply.   If I wanted gmail, I would not have installed k9. ZERO STARS!",_,0
"Used to be the best I've been using K9 for around 3 years and was always impressed until the new update. It seems that style has won over performance.  Deleting emails then going back to the main screen results in the deleted emails still being there then disappearing a few seconds later.

Not only that but the UI is very intelligently thought out especially when it comes to multiple select-deletes, or forwarding emails, and it also easily allows me to send  a reply from any of my email accounts. It is also pretty lightweight and fast. After reading some of the reviews of problems after v.5.0x, I had to go and see what I had and I do have 5.001 which works just fine for me. I have maybe 7 accounts (2 of which are IMAP) and all get handled well. The 5th star will be given when it supports rich text composition (as an option) and when it looses the dumb dog icon - never did like that. Keep up the good work!",_,213
Email forwarding Doesn't forward attachments from IMAP server.,_,0
issues with saving to draftsK9 doesn't save the signature in the draft.Therefore it forgets changes in the signature that were made for this particular email.And it saves quotations from previous emails to the draft even if you clicked on the x to not include them.If you reopen the draft with K9 Mail the signature will be the default one again.If you open it with another email program (IMAP) it won't display any signature at all (at least Thunderbird didn't),bug+,0
Wipe Out Last 2 upgrades have wiped out all saved and deleted emails. Other than screen printing not much of a way to save one external to the program.

"Can't save attachments, better than default mail client I've been Using k-9 for years.  Overall it does a decent job.  It doesn't allow html signatures and more recently the setting for sending mail as Outlook style or Gmail styles won't switch.   On my new Galaxy S7 Edge it's now stuck on Gmail style and puts my signature at the very bottom of all email replies.  Unfortunately this is enough for me uninstall.",_,0

I've used this app for several years and the fact I could easily set it up for multiple self hosted accounts was initially what drew me to it.

Notifications raised incorrectly with multiple accountsIf you have multiple accounts for K-9 and you get new email in them you should get one notification per account. What actually happens is that new emails are listed under the wrong notification. For example if I have account A and account B. 1. I get an email from A2. A notification is created for A. This is correct. 3. I get an email from B.4. A new notification is created for B. This is also correct. 5. The notification for A is updated with the email from B turning it into a multi-line notification. This is incorrect.Seen on: K-9: master branchAndroid: Nougat (7.0)Nexus 6P,bug+,0

K-9 is an app that you will appreciate more as you learn its features.  I've been using it about 6 months.  My opening page displays the two accounts where I can select all the Email, just Unread Email, or the IMAP folders.  Each account has a different Home key color and sound notification.  To be absolutely, sure K-9 was the best for my needs, I evaluated several IMAP Email clients for synchronization, usability, and most importantly, battery drain.  K-9 draws the least power; much less than the default Email client that came with the phone.  Take some time to understand the setup menus, and you will be rewarded with an Email client that will do a fantastic job.",_,214

Settings Export/Import I have 3 accounts in K9 and performed an export from an old device to a new device. Only one account (IMAP) worked afterwards. The two POP3 accounts did not work after import. I had to delete and recreate the accounts for the two POP3 mailboxes in order for them to work. I can provide the settings file (privately) if needed.,bug+,0
"HORRIBLE NEW ICON. A good email client especially if you have a number of accounts, very configurable and I've not had a problem in several years. Two reasons for not giving 5 stars: lack of Exchange integration, which means I'm forced to run another client for work accounts; and did I already mention the incredibly ugly new   icon? If it doesn't revert to the former or something similar, I will have to find a replacement client; it is the most unpleasant icon on my phone and any less useful software looking as ugly would have already been discarded.",_,222
"UPDATE: Wow, the new icon is garish!   I really enjoy K9 Mail, but I keep getting notifications on my Gmail accounts that someone has my passwords. Until I started using this client, I never had a problem. I'm worried because you have to choose less secure settings in Gmail that it makes my accounts vulnerable to attack.",_,0

"Strong product You guys fixed an old problem, so this needed an update. Some features aren't very intuitive, but overall, very good.",_,0
"Puzzled There is so much to like about this app. It is with real regret that I am probably going to uninstall it  because I can't get it to work for me. I am using it on Android 6 with eight accounts using pop3. The problem is that mail is downloaded on some accounts only to disappear, never to be seen again. I have googled this (and the problem is widespread) but no answers that work. I am prepared to believe that it is a configuration issue but I am obviously too thick to work it out. And there is no manual.",_,0
Excellent App! Never had any problems keep up the good work,_,0
I cannot send email from my AOL accounts. I am uninstalling.,_,0
POP3 Accounts Stopped Working Wife and I have Android 5.0 on our Note 3's. POP3 Accounts with Comcast no longer working. Galaxy Tab S2 w Android 5.1.1 works OK with K9. What gives?,_,0
"Didnt work Apparently its suppossd to detect gmail settings. Nope, doesnt.",_,0
Didn't get it to work Tried several times to get it to work and failed. Other programs on the market know how to automatically import the email settings from the email accounts.,_,0
Doesn't populate account information well to other devices Exporting account settings to device memory or external storage is done easily. However the other device is INCAPABLE of retrieving that information from local storage for import. The import procedure INSISTS that you provide a file from a cloud service (Google Drive or Drop Box). I find that to be an insecure option.,_,0
Best email client available I have used K9 since my first Android device. Easily handles multiple accounts and simplifies managing your email. Currently using it on a Samsung Galaxy Note 3,_,0
Seems to be working well I have 2 email accounts that k9 seems to be handling quite well. No complaints.,_,0
Accounts wouldn't access. Trying several apps but this one would never connect to my email account.   All the rest did.,_,0
"Essential app if you have multiple email accounts This application allows tens of accounts, mixed POP3 and IMAP.  I think its the closest one can come to Mozilla Thundebird email client on a tablet or phone.  The only things I found missing were 1) the ability to move mails from one IMAP server to another IMAP, 2) the ability to search the subject line separately and more quickly than always searching the entire email text. 3) Filters",_,0
"Love the backup feature and unified inbox The worst part of getting a new phone or tab is having to add all your email addresses back in. I have a lot. With K9 I can back the accounts up, with a file manger I put them on google drive and then import to my new device. Only wish I could export directly to a cloud account.",_,0
"Brilliant with room for improvement I've been using K9 for a long time now with no major complaints. I love being so in control with the variety of settings. Only 2 things prevent 5 stars: 1) IMAP accounts often report old unread messages as new and throw notifications. 2) Without the ability to copy settings from one account to another, setting up new accounts just how you want them can be tedious.",_,223
Best Android Email Client Works well for multiple accounts. Can set notifications/polling for each individual account. Can export all account settings to a new device which is very convenient if managing multiple accounts with different domains. As good or better than any email client I have used on any OS.,_,0
Just what I needed Much Better than the stock mail app lots of customization and flexibility. Multiple accounts support .. keep up the great work,_,0
Tried but could not set up my account on kit kat 4.4 device but on the other device your app work fine. Please help. Thank you.,_,0
"Outstanding Powerful email client. I highly recommend this app as an alternative to the native android app, which is super basic let's face it. Although I guess K9 is only really useful if you have multiple email accounts of which some or all are not GMail accounts.",_,0
Does everything I expect and a little bit more. Has worked flawlessly for me over a series of five devices and with four different email accounts. Well done K-9 team.,_,0
Update killed it Used to work perfect and now I get force closes and can't send even after a complete reset the after hours of tech support I tried added the account back into k9 while leaving the old one still in k9 and it sent an email once then crashed again deleted all accounts and added them back and again some send some don't no matter what hour outbox says it looks like it sent but never get delivered anywhere.. I this is only on some accounts for the mail account.,_,224

"No POP3? Can't find an option to set up for POP3.  Therefore, can't use.",_,0
Love it! Sooooo much faster than the stock Samsung email app. My email accounts update almost instantly. Deleting emails is quick also. Only problem is I can't get my work email to work with it and my work uses Exchange. My IT dept can't get it work either. So I use K-9 just for my personal emails.,_,0
"A few quirks I wish would be fixed. Overall, it's a very good email client. The best I've seen on android. But really any setting beyond the most basic must be changed for each account individually. I ask for an option where you can select what settings to apply to all selected accounts. Currently, I find a setting I want to change, then end up changing it 8 more times for my other accounts. If this could be changed, it would be 5 stars. As it is, changing the settings for all the accounts individually is too much of a pain.",_,225
